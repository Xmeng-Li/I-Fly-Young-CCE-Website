          "question": "As a professor of research at Smart Cities in security, privacy, and cloud, how would you describe your profession in your own words?",
          "answer": "One aspect is as a teacher. I prefer to call myself an educator instead of a professor because one of my major duties is to guide my students in picking up the skills needed to be successful in their intended careers. Another aspect is my background handling traditional computer networks. In these past decades, we have witnessed the growth of smart devices, particularly the Internet of Things (IoT) technology like our modern smart mobile devices. The concept called Smart Cities, or Smart Communities, has become realistic because now we can embed so many smart computing, communication and storage devices in our living environment. These devices extend our human senses whether it's thinking or decision-making procedures. Human society is moving into a new era where computers are just like smart tele-devices in your hand. You have all kinds of IoT technology embedded into physical environments, and human beings will have better sensing and control of their environment. Overall, my research at Smart Cities is exciting as IoT technology continues to evolve significantly."

          "question": "Do you believe your research has been fully realized? What are some of the challenges in the field that you are facing?",
          "answer": "Some of the challenges that I must face are similar to what many people in this area face. When you ask people about these challenges, they mostly talk about technical issues. For example, comparing the information generated from different environments using smart devices that are constantly computing, communicating, storing, consuming energy, and more. There will be gaps in my knowledge, but those challenges do not bother me. I think a real major concern people should worry about is not the lack of more powerful technologies, but we are not making the environment better. In fact, we are destroying it and have already ruined a lot of ecosystems. When God gave believers free will, humans made decisions better for us because materials did not seem to control the environment. Honestly, I believe that the solution is beyond the scope of technology."

          "question": "In today's society, there is a big concern about device security and the privacy of individual users. Could you share more about this area of your research?",
          "answer": "The main area that my research group focuses on is privacy protection. We collaborate with the campus police department and the Air Force Research Lab. Both need to have access to a surveillance system to read their footage of any environment. The problem is as human beings, as a citizen, and as a community, we do not want our activities to always be overseen behind us. For instance, in today’s society, elders suffering from health issues result in news reports of unfortunate accidents. Some elders fall in their homes, but nobody knows and a couple of days later it’s already too late. Now, families use smart sensors to monitor the movement of their elders. I talked to some of those people, and they say, “[o]kay, that sounds good, but I don’t want someone to look at me when I stay home.” You do not want to be embarrassed when someone can virtually observe you. Because of this dilemma, our team has some duties to manage people’s activities like generating some metadata: trying to describe the status of monitors by outsourcing an image or voice to other people, which identifies what he or she is doing. However, our team simply just does not do that, but we keep reporting whether he or she is good in terms of heartbeat rate or temperature. We can report on those statistics, but there is no longer any room to grow as it becomes an ethical dilemma. You want to get a service out of these smart devices, but you do not want to reveal too much personal information."

          "question": "It seems your team deals with how consumers react to modern technology, tracking, and surveillance. Could you talk about your challenges when managing a team?",
          "answer" : "A major challenge for our team is how I motivate my group members to move forward and work effectively with each other. How you frame what you say is difficult because some are very sensitive to certain deliverables. Maybe somebody just wants you to say how they should improve their efficiency, work harder, or other forms of constructive feedback, but it ends up sounding derogatory. Often, many interpret it as being criticized. As a manager, it is the most challenging part of my role because different people have different personalities. One method may be okay for some people like pushing them to reach a higher bar. However, some will be slow to shift in a new direction. By extending the base of how they learn and encouraging them to move forward, our team effectively innovates. However, for the different types of workers, switching to the wrong methods will lead to disaster. For years actually, I did not worry too much about knowledge or skills of my students. When deciding to pursue a graduate program, they often know what their long-term career is, which motivates them to fully understand each concept. However, how they achieve that with different methods is the true challenge. Everyone I work with all has different approaches, personalities, concerns, and worries. Half of the time, I’m a human resource manager disguised as a researcher."

          "question": "How did you find out that you're interested in being an educator?",
          "answer": "When I was in middle school, one of my teachers taught physics class, presented a lot of wonderful devices, and encouraged us to explore different ones. They inspired and kept reminding me how I should work with my group members in the classroom. One story that stands out to me was with one student I taught in my computer architecture course. He was a bit older than the rest of the class so he was very serious. Sometimes, early in the morning, I would arrive at my office around 8:30 AM and he was always standing by the door. After a couple of times, I just asked him, “[w]hy do you have a tailored schedule to get up so early?” As it turned out, he used to be a soldier in the US Army after he graduated from high school, and was deployed to different places. He received a scholarship to pursue an undergraduate degree after he left the army. With this background in mind, I realized that his eagerness to learn these concepts was what drove him to succeed. I think back to how my teachers treated me, and then start to think about my student individual needs. I recognized that there are students that need extra attention outside of the classroom, and valuable lessons like that one is why I continue my teaching career."

        {
          "question": "What drove you to study electrical engineering, get a Ph.D., and then focus specifically on smart devices?",
          "answer": "I was driven by the need to expand my knowledge base on how devices run the world. For instance, we often observe all the data contained in smart devices and choose to embed them. By embedding them, our team can use smart blocks to build new houses and functional units. When installing a thermostat in a given house, it helps to warn us when the temperature is going higher or lower, or raining, or snowing. You question how each of these functions maintains a normal room temperature. This is exactly how my team obtains a better understanding and provides guidance for the future on how to build a better device. Another key motivation that stuck with me was that I always considered human beings with the potential to function as computing devices do. If we can build some device where we can understand and investigate the world, I consider that we, as human beings, could try to figure out how to design the world in God’s image."

          "question": "While you chose to be a professor, have you ever considered pursuing a career in industry rather than in academia?",
          "answer": "Yes, I considered it many years ago. I intended and have worked for entire summers experiencing company work life. However, there are two reasons why I didn’t stay working in that industry. One reason was because of my personality. I do not appreciate my schedules being created by the administration or by others. Instead, I want to make my own agenda. In academia, professors often create their own schedules like establishing course times. The second reason is that any industry makes it clear what tasks you’re going to do each day. However, as a scholar in life, we are mostly driven by our own interests. Despite these benefits, many of my peers from our industry research group left to work for industry, and I was the only one left in academia. Though my decision was quite uncommon for those that graduated in my field of study, I believe working in academia is more fulfilling to me."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are some qualities they think are necessary for being a good researcher or educator?",
          "answer": "For researchers, two of the most crucial traits are, having an open mind to quickly take in new concepts. At the same time, you need a solid foundation like the knowledge and skills we need on evolving engineering concepts. Otherwise, we will be given some new terms, you will not know what they really mean, and it won’t be very useful to you. Second, your patience will be tested, and opening your mind to solutions different from what you expect will reveal more to you. Put yourself in their shoes to see what really is the reason why others see it that way."
        },
        {
          "question": "In industry, a lot of the work is market driven so there is a clear end goal. In research, there is not necessarily a clear goal in mind, so how do you deal with the challenge of not having a clear result?",
          "answer": "For academic research, we often say our work is open-ended, right? So that means the reason is not too clear. As a result, you must say we’re on an ascent while still having an end-goal. The goal is to push the frontier of this area forward. That is what the goal is: we increase the knowledge base of the entire community. So not necessarily everything we propose can be transferred into a product that you see on the market, but what we generate probably will be a product in the future. That is the goal. If you consider the environment of a university, one goal is graduating. That’s another goal we strive for as professors. With some graduate students, I have seen them go from their first year where they can barely write something to real scholars. When they get into the last few years, they do not need much help. Reading the paper of my graduates, whatever they wrote, I can tell most are satisfied. That means my work has really paid off."
        },
        {
          "question": "If you had the chance to talk to your college self as a freshman, what is some advice that you would say to him?",
          "answer": "Well, I think that my college life was filled with a lot of missed opportunities. Even though I did extracurricular activities, I joined a lot of the wrong ones. And I would tell myself how badly I was during that time. I would also tell myself not to pay too much attention to my GPA. Your chosen major is what recruiters pay attention to from your college education. You will always be doing something right when you are shaping the future you have always wanted. Network and make good friends as they will help you get the farthest in your career."

          "question": "How would you describe what you are doing right now, and is there anything else you are currently pursuing?",
          "answer": "For work, I'm currently a software engineer, tech lead in computer aided design at Samsung Austin Research Center. We call the CAD. It's a software position in hardware design, or an optimization research guy who is embedded in a massive complex problem that may require software and hardware knowledge at the same time. We develop, integrate, and maintain CAD software platforms that optimize and automate the design process in semiconductor products. In this case, we are responsible for memories and custom circuits like analog circuits, and RFICs (radiofrequency integrated circuits), that are designed from circuit to layout, manufacturing, validation, bring up and then the cycle of new features or new validations that are received through Silicon and the products. Right now, we're focused on graphics processing units, GPUs that go into Samsung's current and next generation phones, including the folding phone. So you're going to see it coming in even bigger batches this coming spring. What I love about this position. As you can guess, it's a software engineering position, but you need to understand the problem enough to fix it. So as an analogy from the Fast and Furious series, if you want a nice engine modification, you must be the guy who's been at the wheels, who knows the engines and who knows who your opponents are, live your life a quarter mile at a time. So that requires you to learn a lot of different things, and work with different people. And that's really what I enjoy. I had a PhD from the same field, but it wasn't my first subject matter. I popped through several fields from undergraduate to master, halfway PhD and then restarted on this current PhD. What I found out is the versatility of learning new things, and how my current field fits my character quite well. So that's where my source of joy comes from. They train my adaptability, and it is a field where they say a PhD is training. If you have that training you could use it anywhere, and I think research and development is naturally a good field to do."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you talk a little bit about your journey to where you're currently pursuing. How did you end up doing what you do now?",
          "answer": "From an overall perspective, there is the realization that life is like a massive time bound optimization. If you look at it from the beginning, you might gain some new perspectives from every step. Now we will start from the beginning, given the 2020 vision of hindsight, it was influenced plus the choices you make as always, right? I was born to a family of postdocs and PhDs, and my uncles and my dad are all in engineering fields, some in chemistry, some in petroleum engineering, very well educated. But I also see the geekiness along the way and how that's become a stumbling block when it comes to interacting with people or being a funny or a humorous person. Eventually, the education system pushed me towards an engineering path and then within that path, I started off as a signal and systems engineer. This is my undergraduate training thing – radar imaging, satellite imaging, noise reduction, and high advanced communication circuits and stuff. But it's obviously something that just didn't work out with my interest. Because those systems essentially go into missiles that take lives. It's a military application. So I transferred to image processing, which is just like facial recognition these days. But at that time, after a few years of research and development, I had to apply for UT Austin. Circuit design was the hottest area at that time, so I came here to the circuit design track, but then the circuit is hardware and along the way I found that there is this software application inside the circuit that's called computer aided design. You have data structures, algorithms, and a bunch of time bound optimizations for you to do. So that took a couple of hops and eventually I found my PhD supervisor Professor David Pan from UT Austin, and I did my PhD for five years there.\n\n And the interesting thing here is if you look back, it's fair that everybody gets 24 hours a day only. So back to the point that life is massive time bound optimization. In an optimization problem, you have an objective that you minimize or maximize, and there are also constraints. Constraints means you can't exceed a certain value. If you look at the variables, there is the job or school work, and you got hobbies like sports, music, travel, etc. And there's relationships, your friends and family, and other stuff like transportation, getting stuck in traffic, utility bills, and yard work. There's also entertainment, social media, the time we spend sorting out this massive information streaming into our phone, and personal finance. Because of a highly inflammatory financial situation, everybody needs to know something about what's going on, right? And then there are new opportunities with their cost, like finding a new mentor. If you think your career needs a new boost, you may go find a new mentor, spend time searching for a new job, or a new certificate or maybe even an MBA degree. Therefore, the goal right now is to maximize something subject to the constraint that you pick a subset of what is, and they add no more than 24 hours a day. Also, for your health, you shouldn't spend less than 6 hours sleeping. They are all accounted for and therefore time is very efficient. It needs to be made very efficient, and that comes back to automation and optimization. And that's sort of what we do in hardware design. If a thing is human labor intensive, then they ought to be taken care of automatically by the machine because they do things much faster. And just like all the efficient software we use on our phone, they help us reply to emails or sort out emails, filter out junk, and then recommend Netflix movies to your liking so you don't spend most time searching. And I hope that's a new perspective for the young students who are at school and are considering entering school, because if you quantize these variables, you will see lots of time wasted on things that should have been done much more efficiently and therefore you have a better opportunity to see beyond the horizon and plan."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is there any driving force behind what you do and what you pursue personally? What made you want to pursue the field that you currently are in?",
          "answer": "Sure. I think the work that we do today should be sustainable for the foreseeable future. So how that pieces together is software, hardware, and all the AI systems that will be pieced together in that will be included in basically everything that we see in our life. Very soon this will be common sense that we must understand. And for me, hardware automation is something that's going to be one of the building blocks there. That's why you see all these what we call vendor companies. You heard of Ancestors, and then there's Cadence, Synopsis, and Mentor Graphics, which is now simply design automation. They build tools that help you build hardware much more efficiently and the semiconductor process has scaled so fast that we can now build much more with much less cost. So that's where the trend is. If that trend keeps going at a certain point, if not already, you couldn't keep up with the demand in the work involved to build the system. What’s important here is to smartly automate, and then use AI to build AI systems, and the next step will be hardware that is able to build hardware, and then a software that is able to write software itself. And then who knows what the singularity of technology may be would happen and no one can believe how that would look like today. But there is a bigger picture here. One of the building blocks is understanding software and hardware, how they work and how they optimize together. And I believe computer design is one of the areas that keep you sharp because you learn new things all the time before you can solve the challenges and even before you can identify the weak spots. I think it's a very vibrant area, not in the sense of the new companies that come out of it, but in the sense of really being at the crossroads of many things. It's a very good spot for career development."
        },
        {
          "question": "What would you recommend for college students if they're looking to going into a field that is centered around design work, centered around hardware, software engineering, all the three fields that you sort of connected? Where do you think their starting point should be?",
          "answer" : "That's a good question. I think every person's path can be different. And the concise way to put that is we got this principle. If you want to achieve happiness or personal inner peace, you need to be able to answer the question of who you are, where you are, and where you want to go. No one else can decide that for you. Like me, I'm not like a super extroverted person and if I pretend to be one, to the extent I can get an Oscar, I'm not going to be happy even if I can. So you need to know who you are. You also need to know where you are. Am I at a stage of life were taking risks costs nothing, so I can just explore anything I want? I want to explore whatever the hottest topic currently is. I want to listen to the most active entrepreneurs and venture capitalists ,and where the big money is moving, and I want to be there just as a young guy full of potential and learning potential. Or am I really at a point with lots of responsibilities already, and kind of established track, and looking to jump track comes with its own risk? You could leverage the skills you already have and choose to stay within your strength zone or walk out of your comfort zone. And then the last part is where you want to go. Is it something that you think would serve humans as a human race together? Maybe it's medicine study because of COVID. Maybe it's really communication because miscommunication gets more common. Or is it something else that has a grand purpose? Maybe it's education. At the end of the day, we need that because at a certain point, nothing is easy. You're going to go through a stage where you feel like you really can't take another day, but after another day, you're a different person. You just need a little bit more motivation to really break through that stage. And so it boils down to these three things.\n\n Also remember, time is fair. Everyone only has 24 hours a day. Even the billionaires in the world couldn't get another minute. And then number two, ask where you want to be and then look around if you're at school. Remember, school is not just where class is taught. It's where the greatest minds of the education ecosystem meet – now it's virtually connected because of the pandemic. So, go there as a place to meet new opportunities. If it's work, look for the people you want to be like in five to ten years, and then learn from them early on and see how they think, because a lot of times, decisions you make are who you are. You can't change that, but you can change who you are based on the information and the context. Finally, I think there's no definitive answer. We can find peace anywhere. If you have family duties, it's really a complex situation and therefore try to reflect and have that formula that you can find your inner peace that no one else can take away. So that's really what it is. Something specific for a school student, start with one thing and do it extremely well because many times opportunities would lead you somewhere else. Rather than just trying to find what you love for so many times, why don't you just get something nicely done first, regardless of what that is."        
        },
        {
          "question": "What would you say to a college student who is going through the transition phase, leaving a field that they thought they would enjoy, but are ultimately moving on to something that seems like it could be more applicable to what they want to do as a career?",
          "answer": "That's a very good question. I think it can be very tricky, but I think in the interdisciplinary area, there is to provide resources for people to have a synopsis of what it is like and what it would take in the other field. There are testimonies you're going to see, maybe role models or someone you want to be. There are also people before you, and you can check with them and ask for advice. With all these resources, I would suggest consulting with your track adviser because they know all the latest buttons and bells and whistles in the field. You'll be surprised at what you get if you just ask. Go ahead and ask. The second point is you should prepare to put down quite a lot of hard work because it may not be an easy transition. What I mean by that is twofold. First, you need to protect yourself because you still need to maintain your GPA. If something goes wrong in the middle of the semester, like if you really cannot handle that much or you're overly committed, taking multiple courses from different tracks in the same semester and being chased by the projects, you need to have a stop button. I think in certain schools it is by mid-semester you need to transfer from grade-based to pass or fail based to avoid an F on your transfer, or else you're going to be on probation. So those are the rules you must understand beforehand. It's like the margins. If you're in the financial sector, you need to know your risks. These are the downsides you must protect. The second is the upside, which is the work that you need to lay down ahead of time. Plan your course works accordingly. For example, in a typical integrated circuit course, we have different stages of the design. You learn them, and then you learn maybe analog design and eventually very large-scale integrated circuits where you see all those design tools like the ones we develop in use, and then you will use them to build like a small-scale processor chip. [If you know these stages ahead of time,] maybe you can put some of those skills in the summer before because it's going to be the same project taught by different TAs. They have their different flavors year to year, but the majority is the same. You can check the course website even if you did not choose the course, and maybe save the project before they take down the website. If they have a rank, you can save the top three best results and then maybe talk to them and see how they did it. What is the trick? How much time did they use? These preparations really get you to the right spot when the time an opportunity presents itself. In general, I think you have confidence in yourself because computer engineering and electronic engineering aren't all that different. The fundamental skills are similar, but it's the infrastructure that's different. Maybe it’s micro-architecture compared to circuit design or how to solve differential equations. Or maybe you need to write certain packages in C++. It's a lot of work, but if you slice it and do it one at a time, it is not rocket science."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you talk a little bit more about tips for future college students who are maybe looking to enter college, but don't really know whether engineering is the right track for them or if they just hold an interest in it? What advice would you give to those students who are looking to go to college, looking to study CS, looking to study something engineering and just don't really know what to expect?",
          "answer": "That's a very tricky question. I think at a certain point my kids will start asking that question to me. because to me, it's highly driven by trends. I can imagine that when I was in senior high school, I didn't know what civil engineering really means or industrial engineering really means. It sounds industrial, but what it does is very different. And I didn't know that electrical engineering in my track particularly meant radar imaging, which if I knew, I wouldn't have gone for it. But I know there's a value in data. If it's an important enough question, many people would have asked it. You could just search it up, because the number one thing you could find is all the nice chronicles that you guys have already put out there. Number two is in case it's very deep philosophical or the questions that need sound arguments, Google would have pointed you to Quora. If you log in, there are tons of experts there to ask, and if you are lucky enough, you can make a few very influential friends. Finally, if you're going to college, you have all that it takes to take risks. It doesn't matter what you pick, you can pick one, just start at it, but pay attention to the friends around you. What is happening? What are some of the hottest trends? Is it AI? Is it software writing software? Is it a self-driving car or is it really living on Mars? It's going to be changing depending on the time. For every generation the mission is different. But stay adaptable, stay flexible, and don't be afraid to just go ahead and do something again. Take one thing and do it the best and you will be led to the next opportunity. That's really what I believe, especially if you're that early."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are sort of the hottest trends you see right now that you think most engineers, if not all engineers, should pay attention to or should at least understand in a general knowledge sort of sense?",
          "answer": "In general, there are two big things. The first thing is in our career as an engineer, I think we write software right now to design hardware, so we call it hardware design automation. I look forward to the time when we can automate software design where you write a piece of software and what it does is write software. So there won't be any software engineers, just software architects. You say on the top level, I want a pipeline of this and that, and time should be less than this. The memory shouldn't be more than that because I deploy on maybe 5% of the critical servers in town and that should be enough budget wise, and they just give you a certain implementation. So here is your platform and then you can use it to do other things as a service. What we take into those challenges is the system design perspective. If AI is very good at implementing miscellaneous details, then we should be able to make the strategic decisions. And that requires good knowledge in a broad range of subjects and the ability to learn fast, and the curiosity to think that you should know that much. It's going to be very important. The second thing is that we live in a time that is unprecedented in terms of financial practices and inflation. Knowing how financial engineering is done and following the news of this few percent thing, like a ten year treasury yield. Those are numbers that really affects all of us, so it's going to be critical as well."
        },
        {
          "question": "Critical of what aspects, do you mind me asking?",
          "answer": "I think just look at the trend we started at scaling of transistors. There was an analogy way back, that the transistor process was getting smaller and cheaper. Now, if that were the case in the auto industry, a Tesla would cost $1,000 like a laptop. But that was in the beginning. The scaling factor done wrong is the reverse, which is in the case of all the money that we printed. Knowing that would change how we think about work- life balance, and how we really put knowledge to our advantage rather than sticking to one area but losing the big picture that we call life. Imagine what life could have been one or five or ten years ago. With that framework of knowledge, go back to do that area that you are focusing on now. That would make a lot more sense than not knowing where we are. This comes back to the second point. Know yourself, know where you are, and know where you're going to. We wouldn't know where we are if we don't know the big picture. Finance is a very important part of that picture. And then there's technology as well as education. That's a very great point to sort of summarize a lot of what you were saying earlier, not just specifically to the financial industry. I know that's of great importance at the time being during the pandemic, but also just the key pointers of knowing where you are, knowing what your passion is, and knowing where the industry is going to go."

          "answer": "I appreciate your efforts. I think you are doing a great thing for the audience that they may not realize, but the team, including yourself at CCE, I know there are lots of visionaries driving it. They put down the work as part of their passion. I admire that and I hope I could put more time into it in the future as my personal situation gets better. But really my best wishes. I think this future ten to twenty years is going to be very exciting, and we face lots of problems, but it's very exciting to see entrepreneurs and pioneers in all kinds of fields, just making their names, making their impacts. If you don’t prick up your ears, you could have missed them. So it is good that you don't need to search for them anymore, because they're right there. So being early in life is that you have more time back to the time bound and more time, therefore more ambition, more grander goals. My best wishes to the new generation. I hope they're much better than ours and then their next generation will be even better, and then at some point we'll solve that problem."

My team is responsible for IP (Intellectual Property) assembly and the SoC creation, which includes the methodology for optimal efficiency, agility, and productivity. Our work also involves coming up with an IP build and release methodology. So there's a lot of cross functional collaboration and coordination. In our team, we always need to maintain a delicate balance between project execution and methodology improvement. But personally, I also spend a lot of my time on people management, which is something I'm very passionate about, to build the next leaders in the company."
        },
        {
          "question": "How has your work evolved over time for Nvidia? Has there been any changes to your position and responsibilities?",
          "answer": "Definitely! I was already a director of engineering in my first company. I was focusing on ARM CPU design, but I needed to take a break from it. I spent about eleven years in ARM CPU design, right out of college. I really enjoyed it, but after a while I wanted to do something different. I've been focusing a lot on the CPU piece, and now I want to see a bigger picture. So I consciously decided to move on to the system level, and I decided to go into SoC design. \n\n Before I got to Nvidia, I actually moved to AMD first, spending about one year at AMD and then left there for Nvidia. When I first joined the company, I made it very clear that I didn't want to do people management because I just changed to a different field, and I wanted to learn the technology. I also wanted to know more about the company. I wanted to spend more time learning more about the technical stuff and things like that because naturally I like learning, so I wanted to make sure I spend enough time understanding and learning new technology before I start managing people again. In fact, my manager knew about my background and every year he asked me if I wanted to go back to management. I kept saying no until one day when he decided to leave the company, and I was asked by his manager to step into this role. After taking some time to consult with my family and also my spiritual mentor, I decided to take that responsibility. Since then, I have reignited the passion once again, even though people management can be very frustrating at times. In my first company, I didn’t think I was a good manager, because I was new at people management and I was focusing too much on my technical work."

        {
          "question": "You talked a little about how as you develop experience, the way you manage has evolved over time. Today, how do you manage your team of hardware engineers?",
          "answer": "I'll say my style is more of a servant-leadership. Basically, I like to enable and empower my engineers, so I spend a lot of time behind the scenes working with them, coaching them and things like that. But once I think they are ready and assign them to lead a certain project, I try to make sure I allow them to shine and be the face of that particular task. So for most of the time in the meeting, I'll just be quiet and let them do their own thing, unless they need some help or they don't have some details. Because sometimes as an individual contributor, you may be limited to a certain kind of project, while as a manager, you get to see all different projects. So I will only interject when I need to. But for the most part, I allow them to speak for themselves, and also let them learn from their mistakes. I always encourage people to take risks. But at the same time, you can only take risks after you have done your due diligence in terms of understanding the problem and thinking about all the different considerations. But I like people to understand that it's okay to fail. In fact, this is also our Nvidia culture – If you want to fail, fail early. If we need to pivot to a different solution, then so be it. If you're not taking risks, you're also not going to innovate. You're not going to make huge breakthroughs or major advancements without this. \n\n Also nowadays, I consciously make the decision to always prioritize people over the project. In the past, when things become tough in the project, the focus would just become trying to get work done at all costs. But now I'm more conscious about focusing on people first. Sometimes people may not perform well because of the situation in their family or other stuff in their personal life. So it's actually good to identify that and to be able to work with them or to help them. When their personal situation is under better control, typically their work will also improve. Of course at the end of the day, we still have to deliver our project and do our work excellently, but at the same time we should focus a lot more attention to the people. I think this is a big shift from when I first became a manager."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you share one or two examples of how you managed some difficult situations when you are a manager?",
          "answer" : "I can start by sharing a bad example. As I mentioned earlier, [in the past] as soon as there's some complex situation or issues with the project, I would immediately step in like, okay, get out of the way, and let me do my thing and fix the problem. That is because in my first company, the way to promote a top engineer who does well is to promote them into a manager role, so I was promoted to the manager role not necessarily because they saw me as a good manager although I did show some initiative. Actually that is a wrong concept. Being a manager doesn't necessarily mean being high in position. That is something at Nvidia that we always make very clear. There's a track for individual contributors to focus on technical work, and there's also the management track, which emphasizes on people management, but that wasn't the case in my first company. So, once you become a top engineer, naturally you just become a manager. But they still expect you to continue working on the technical aspect, and that becomes a lot of pressure. So my style would be just let everyone else get out of the way while I go in and fix the problem, and then move on.\n\n But at Nvidia it’s a little bit different, because I think it's about people empowerment, and I've seen different cases. So there'll be cases where maybe somebody just doesn't have the technical details or the knowledge. Then this is just something that I can work with the person to come up with the resources, for example, to find the subject expert, or to have a group of people just to learn together and do brainstorming together. I've also seen cases when my team members have personal situations, whether it's in their marriage or there's some illness in the family that they need to take care of. In these cases, we need to make sure these people have the time that they need to deal with their personal situation, while at the same time for me to be able to find somebody to take over the job, and for them to be able to not worry about losing their job. Because that is the last thing you want to give to somebody who is already dealing with a situation at home. So this is something that has happened before, and recently we just had another similar case, because his personal situation required him to relocate to another country temporarily, and we helped him through that process as well. \n\n The benefit of focusing on people actually goes both ways. As we show our support and our trust to our engineers, they actually also return the favor. They also understand that, okay, we're treating them really nicely as a human being. We actually care about them and things like that. So now as I compare my current team to how it was before, I think these people are more willing to give their personal effort. That becomes a mutual trust in the working relationship, so it's not necessarily just one way or the other. \n\n I think that is also tied to my Christian faith. As my spiritual condition and faith matured, it helped me as a person and therefore as a manager. Having a good culture at Nvidia also helps make things easier. In my previous company, the CEO is almost like the hardest working person in the company. So when you have that kind of leadership example, it makes it very difficult [to foster a culture that values everyone’s life quality and a culture of stability]. Versus in Nvidia, where most of the managers that I know, from a low level manager all the way to our CEO, we can see a lot of emphasis on family and taking time off to spend time with the family. In fact, all our managers are very aware of that. As we are a global company where people are from many different time zones, we always emphasize avoiding meetings during dinner time, when you're supposed to be spending time with your family. So we try our best to avoid meeting time between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. Of course there are cases when we have no choice, like when there are too many time zones that you need to work with, or maybe you have urgent issues, and we may have to do [our meetings on an unfavorable time], but otherwise, by default, we try to avoid that time. So it's really nice to have that culture to begin with."

          "question": "That's great to hear about Nvidia's culture and sort of how you've been inspired by it. Thank you for going into detail about that. I want to take a step back and ask, how did you end up pursuing your career?",
          "answer": "My journey is kind of by accident, so that's why I really believe it's tied to my Christian faith. I did my undergraduate in electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University, and then I did my master's in electrical engineering at Stanford, and then I did a master's diploma in strategy and innovation from Oxford University. Let's start from my undergraduate. To be honest, I came from Indonesia, so unlike today's age, where there's so much information with the Internet everywhere, I didn't have any of that. So I didn't really know what I was going to do in high school. I just knew that I loved science since I was young, but I really didn't know what to expect. I didn't even know what kind of majors were available. All I knew was I wanted to work on something that has a lot of math or maybe physics or chemistry, so any of those would do. Then I decided that I wanted to come to the US, but I didn't really know what to expect either. As I said, I didn't have a lot of information, and I always thought that after graduating, I'd go back to Indonesia. So my first thought would be like, OK, what can I do with my degree when I come back to Indonesia? In Indonesia, if I wanted to use my engineering degree, it’d probably be in manufacturing. So because of that, the original major I chose when I applied for college was industrial system engineering.\n\n After I came to the US, obviously I got more exposed to information and started talking to people. But the reason why I changed my major to electrical engineering was actually out of my ego. It was just because one day my friend made a joke. A simple comment like, oh, industrial engineering is not really engineering. Not that I agree with him, but at that time I was offended. I was like, what do you mean? He said it's not really engineering because there's not a lot of math or a lot of science involved, so it's no wonder for you to get a 4.0 GPA. So I was offended. I mean, he was joking and wasn't being serious, but I took it very seriously. Then I was like “Okay, what major do you consider to be the most difficult for engineering?” So he then mentioned chemical engineering and electrical engineering. So I was like, okay, between the two, I like chemistry, so let me go to the Chemical Engineering Department, and then I asked for advice for transfer. The department said I could transfer, but I needed to take more chemistry classes. Yet I didn't want to take more classes, so I went to the electrical engineering major, and I asked the same questions. “Oh, yeah, you can transfer all your credit.” So I switched to an electrical engineering major, and that's how I switched my majors because of my ego. I didn't really know what to do with that major afterwards. But thankfully, it turned out to be the right decision. Because at the time of my graduation, it was actually very difficult to find a job in the US if you majored in industrial engineering. Even for chemistry or other popular majors, it was also very difficult, especially for international students. Interestingly, I graduated at the end of 1999, and that was when the dot-com boom and things like that, so computer science and electrical and computer engineering were the hot majors. \n\n I actually also changed my field within electrical engineering because I was originally specialized in control systems – I did my internship for that and that was also my topic of my undergraduate honor thesis. But the quarter before I was about to graduate, I was like, “oh, my goodness, I hated this. I didn't want to do this anymore.” Even though I got a lot of interview opportunities for my work in control systems, I didn't want to. I wanted to do something different, but I also didn't know what to do. So I basically just randomly interviewed with companies. And again, I made my decision out of my ego. You start to see a trend here. I was like, okay, I got my degree in engineering, and I was one of the top students, so I would only do design work. I didn't want to do verification work or any other work. Again, this is the wrong mindset now that I'm in the industry, but back then designer jobs were being thought of more highly. So there were some jobs which I just declined the interviews, and it took me five months from graduation to get my first job, and it was in CPU design. Again, I didn't know what I was going to do with it. I just wanted to be a designer anyway, so as long as someone was willing to hire me as a design engineer, I would just do it. So that's how I joined a startup company in CPU design, and I fell in love with it very quickly. I ended up spending eleven years of my life doing that. Until one day I was like, okay, what else can I do with it? When the boredom started to come in, things became just routines, and you just didn't get the time to think and learn new things, I started to ask myself again about my next step. That's when I decided that I wanted something higher level than CPU design. Because of my role as a director, I was able to see different aspects and a lot of cases, in both the technical side and the marketing side. I noticed that sometimes you could have a really wonderful CPU design, but if the system doesn't fully utilize the capability of the CPU, your product still suffers. Another reason why I wanted to move to the system level was because I felt that working on the system level got me closer to the final product, so you can actually think about how it contributes to the actual performance in terms of the value that it can add to the application and to the user. So those two were the main reasons why I decided to move to system design, and that's how I eventually came into the SoC design role at Nvidia."

          "question": "If you were able to talk to yourself from that time when you were struggling making the decisions, what would you tell yourself or change?",
          "answer": "Actually I would not want to change a thing because I'm happy where I am now. So if it took all this journey for me to get to where I am today, I'm not sure if I want to change it. But I would love to have more information to make a more informed decision rather than this kind of quick decision. But at the same time, I think it is part of life. That's the nice thing about life. There's a chance for do-over, and you never know. So I think it does not really matter that much when you make a mistake. What is more important is that, when you make a mistake, do you know when it's the time to move on or to pivot to something else? Also, when wonderful things happen to you, do you know if it's not your credit? Like in my case, it's not my credit. Do you learn to be thankful about that? And how to take advantage of this fortunate opportunity and hopefully it can help benefit other people as well. So I'm not sure if there's anything specifically that I would like to change, but I think maybe having a more informed decision is always better."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you talk a little bit about why you got your master's diploma in Oxford after working for a couple years?",
          "answer": "Yeah. I mentioned the culture of my previous company, not AMD, but the previous one. There was definitely a lot of emphasis on your work and not so much on having a good balance and integration with your personal life. And I've seen cases where engineers don't get to speak up for themselves and things like that. So one of the main reasons why I wanted to do this was because I thought I could just go to school and learn about management, and then come back. Maybe I'm going to get into some executive role and then change the culture from the top down. So that was kind of my idealistic thinking. But in reality, that's not how the company works, yet I didn't know that. \n\n After graduation, I was excited with all these different possibilities that I could go into, but this is where my Christian faith came in. Each time when I started seeking a new opportunity, there were just a lot of roadblocks and a lot of situations that happened in my personal life that stopped me from pursuing the opportunity. During that time I actually did volunteer work in South Africa to learn how to utilize my business skills, and how to build a Kingdom business. That took me into a different journey where I spent a few months training with other people and then ended up with a two week journey in South Africa to work with the local businesses. So I got distracted with something else. And soon afterwards, something happened with my father in Indonesia that caused me to spend four months in Singapore and Indonesia with my family during that year as well. And when I came back, when this opportunity came, I didn't really feel at peace about going into that direction at all. So there were a lot of situations that required me to really quiet down and really try to listen to what my next move would be. And then one day during my quiet time with God, it was very clear God directed me that He wanted me not to touch this for the time being. Would you be willing to obey? So this was actually the year when I was going to be asked to become a manager. This happened a few months before that. When that message became clear to me, I was like, okay, I'm willing to wait and see what happened. Even though at that time I did not really understand, my commitment to Nvidia was not 100%, and I was still planning to pursue something else with my degree, I chose to obey and wait without knowing what's going to happen. And then I started to dedicate myself to my work and then see what's going on. A few months later, that's when I was asked to take the management role, and it became a decision point for me because I needed to be fully committed if I were going to manage the team. So again, after spending some time on it, I decided to say yes and dedicate my time to it. I committed to the team, and since that point on I've been very happy and also learned the lesson. You may be able to force the culture from the top, but unless you're working with the people, you may not know what their real needs are. So I feel very good about where I am today because I'm with the people. I'm able to influence those on my team through my position. In the end, it didn't turn out exactly the way I thought it was going to be when I first decided to pursue that degree. But at the same time, I think it brought me to a good place today."
        },
        {
          "question": "Tips for Pursuing Similar Career Path",
          "answer": "Well, to me, life is a journey, so I think it's okay to not know what you want to do or where your career is headed. Very few people know exactly the one thing they're going to do for the rest of their life. For many of us, I think you venture to one thing and then you learn and grow. Maybe you [will also discover that you] want to do something else [in that process]. I think it's important to have passion and commitment. In everything that you do, you need to have passion. Without the passion, it's very difficult for you to give the commitment and to give your best. Try to find the intersection between your passion and your talent. You're passionate about something, but if you don't have the talent or the skill, it's going to be more difficult. There's a place where you can find a good balance between them, and that would be a good start. \n\n Also, even if you originally think you want to stick to one thing, you are still probably going to end up doing multiple things, so think about how to have a strong foundation that will allow you to move around. Sometimes it's harder to move from one field to the other, so if you start with the most difficult first, in my case, CPU design is arguably one of the more difficult fields. So by starting my career from CPU design, it's actually easier for me to move into other areas within hardware development versus the other way around. So allow that kind of flexibility and definitely take risks. Experiment with different things, and don't be afraid of that. Do give it time before you call it quits. Sometimes people quit too early and not give it enough time, while others spend too much time doing something that will not go anywhere. \n\n College, and school in general, is very good at teaching the framework and the discipline for learning. But afterwards, it's all you in terms of how you build upon that foundation. From a career perspective, though, I think having knowledge in specific areas is very useful. It's going to set you apart from other applicants when you look for a job. So if you can take specific classes, training, or certification into the field or the area you want to go into, that's going to help set you apart from other candidates. I also think that collaboration and communication skills are very important, because one person cannot solve everything. No matter how good you are, even if you can, it's not going to be scalable. You need to be able to work with other people, be able to express your opinion, your view, and treat each other respectfully."

Our team is trying to discover the new target for a more innovative cancer treatment, which hopefully will eventually help the patients with cancer. We first try to identify the target [molecules], and we try to find a potential new medicine, either large molecules like the antibody or small molecules [which might interact with the target molecules and produce therapeutic effects]. We then test those chemical compounds first on cell lines (in vitro), and then in mouse study (in vivo). Once we establish whether those compounds have anti-tumor efficacy in a mouse model, we move forward to the monkey model to check whether those potential medicines are well tolerated in monkeys before moving forward to the clinical trial for the patients. So that's my overall job, mentoring my senior scientists and scientists to do the lab work, trying to guide them and drive the program from early discovery all the way to phase one [clinical trial]."

        {
          "question": "Can you define the terms “in vitro” and “in vivo” in layman’s terms?",
          "answer": "In vitro means that you work on something outside any species body. For example, you can test the compounds on the immune cells or tumor cells isolated from a patient sample, or you can test on a well established tumor cell line, either from an external or internal cell bank. Next you try to understand whether those cell lines are sensitive to your potential medicine. For example, if you test your innovative drug, and you do see immune cells start to activate and kill the tumor cells, then that would be the key experiment you want to see. We also try to understand the interactions between immune cells and tumor cells in in vitro studies, and how we can leverage the therapeutic drug that activates the same T cells, NK cells, or dendritic cells to activate the immune system to kill the tumor cells. It’s a very similar concept as the COVID vaccine. You want to start with the in vitro assay before you actually start in the mouse model or the monkey study. You want to see whether you can actually boost the immune cell response to the virus [on a petri dish] before you get into in vivo study, which is within the species like mice or monkeys."

        {
          "question": "There is a low success rate in biomedical research. How do you address the pressures of almost certain failure to develop new solutions?",
          "answer": "That's a great question. Drug discovery’s success rate, like you said, is pretty low, since you may identify many potential medicines that are not as effective as you expect in the beginning. Even if those compounds show strong efficacy, they might not be safe for the patients! In that case, you will have to deprioritize or terminate the program. Since there is a lot of deprioritization down the road, you must adjust yourself and realize that this is part of the work. \n\n But how can we overcome [the repeated frustration from program deprioritization and termination]? [I believe the key is to focus on] your initial motivation. If you eventually can identify the medicine and test in the clinical trial, and really help the patient and their family to prolong the survival or even cure them, that would be a strong motivation to make you keep doing that. So regardless of how many kinds of challenges or how many times of failure happen down the road, you can come back and remind yourself – your initial motivation is to help the patients eventually. Some brilliant scientists enjoy working on basic science problems in academia and pursue the faculty position, which can also be helpful in terms of innovation. While the other way is to try to apply the science you learn into the drug discovery and make it more applicable. Imagine all the biology, physiology and biochemistry you learned from college or in grad school, and now you can directly translate it to the industry to develop a new medicine to overcome some of the limitations of standard of care. Right now all the standard of care, either it is the chemotherapy, target therapy, or the immunotherapy, they all have limitations, and not all patients respond well to the treatment. That is why you want to see if you can find a new medicine that can help those patients who did not respond well to the current treatment. I believe that would be your motivation to overcome the high failure rate in drug discovery."

          "question": "What is the driving force behind your work and what you pursue?",
          "answer" : "When I was a college student, we learned a lot of engineering and science. Most of my classmates in college were more driven by the engineering part, so they ended up working in the semiconductor industry because we majored in chemical engineering. You either go to a traditional company or go to the semiconductor industry to do the chemical process. However, during my college time, I was not really interested in fluid dynamics, transport phenomena, or applied mathematics. Instead, I was extremely interested in biology and biochemistry as well as molecular biology. Even though most of the biology-related courses were not the core courses of our department, I still registered for many of these optional courses, and I always got very good grades like A+ because I am very interested and read a lot of textbooks. [Since this is a very different interest from most of my classmates,] I was trying to understand what could be my next step after college, and I ended up pursuing a master's degree in Taiwan for cancer biology and biochemistry for two years, which is again very different from my classmates. In addition to attending the courses, we also have to spend most of the time in the lab and do the in vitro testing that I mentioned earlier, trying to identify some compounds that can treat the tumor cells. If those compounds are effective, how do they kill the tumor cell? How can we improve and understand the biology more? \n\n When I was about to graduate from my master program, I tried to think about my next step – what would be the potential career development for me? I can either stay in the country and work in the industry, or go to the United States to study for my Ph.D. Eventually, I decided to finish my military service and then applied for the Ph.D. program in the United States. Back in 2008, I went to Johns Hopkins University to pursue my Ph.D. in the oncology and immunology program. In my Ph.D, I tried to understand the interaction between the tumor cells and the microvasculature, which is part of our circulating bloodstream. How does the tumor cell metastasize from the primary location to the second organs through the bloodstream? How do they interact with the immune cells? I tried to think hard and understand the mechanism of action because I really want to do the drug discovery. This is again very different from my peers who wanted to pursue postdoc training in academia, because they are probably more interested in faculty positions. \n\n After I finished my Ph.D., I tried to apply for the industry job but got many challenges and hurdles, because usually in the industry they are more interested in the candidates with more industry experience, which is very difficult to have for a fresh Ph.D. graduate. I submitted my resume over and over again to many different places, but all failed. I thus tried to connect with many different senior people, tried attending the conference, tried to understand the biotech industry more, tried to improve my phone interview skills, and tried to improve my resume. After all these challenges and improvement, I ended up getting an offer from one of the top 10 big Pharma, the Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical Company, to do the drug discovery. So that is how I ended up having my career at this point."

          "question": "What is the difference between being a research scientist at a company in industry compared to being in academia?",
          "answer": "These are really two distinct tasks. I think for young college students it may be too early for you to think ahead. But when you have a chance to start your graduate school, that would be a good time to start thinking about it. So, after you graduate from a Ph.D. or master, you have to think about whether you want to go to academia or to the industry. If you want to stay in academia and apply for a faculty position, it will be more like an independent lab setting. You will get several years of postdoc training, maybe 3 to 4 years, or even 5 years and above. Typically, you do the innovative science by the lab work, trying to publish the paper in the journal to show your strength, and applying for the faculty position. You might apply for an instructor job in the beginning or assistant professor, whether it's a non-tenure or tenure track. Usually the admission rate of an assistant professor job is less than 10%, or I would say 5% sometimes, but you don't have to be discouraged by that. I mentioned the low admission rate not to suggest you go to the industry, but instead to encourage you to really think about whether you are interested in basic science in academia. The professors who won the Nobel Prize – they are really motivated by the new discovery and the science they found in the lab, and that is the motivation which keeps them thinking about the current challenges, thinking about the new ways to solve it, designing the experiments and performing them. On the real side, once you become a professor, you also have to recruit postdocs and graduate students, mentor them to do the lab work, and write the research grants for funding. If you don't have funding, you don't have any budget money to establish a lab because you must purchase all the equipment and reagents. Usually the grant acceptance rate is pretty low, too – most of the grants have an acceptance rate of less than 10%, and for some big grant like R01 from NIH, it would be less than 5%. So most of the time professors have to submit the grant proposal but may not get accepted for several times. So the failing rate is similar to the drug discovery rate – it's just a different setting. And then you try to publish your paper about cutting edge science, and you can be invited to different conferences and present your research, and you keep writing more grants and try to get funded for your new research projects. That is typical for the faculty track. \n\n The drug discovery industry track is not an independent lab, which is very different from academia. In academia, you may have peers like other assistant professors, but typically you are independent. Whereas in the industry, you always work as a team – you work with the antibody drug development team, the clinical team, the regulatory team, the commercial team, and the in vivo team. It is going to be very cross-functional and dynamic, and some people like this kind of teamwork because there will be more face-to-face interactions. Each team works on a different part, and they go through the communication and drive the drug discovery process altogether as a team. You don’t need to worry about grants in the industry. We can order the reagents and equipment without worrying about writing a grant, but by the end of the day it is all about the cost. So many professors end up with no grant, and they have to transfer to a different job, which is one of their risks. There is also a risk in the industry – you might get laid off when there is a reorganization within big Pharmas, but usually this does not happen very frequently. Some people have a myth that you won’t have to worry about losing a job like people in the industry once you get your tenure in academia. It's not the case, because even if you are an associate professor, if you run out of grants, you will have no money [to do research or pay the salary for your postdocs and graduate students]. Similarly, in industry, if you get laid off, it is not because you're not doing a good job. It's usually because the leadership team of the Pharma or biotech decide to focus more on other stuff, like vaccines and mRNA technology, and they may double down the resources, the budget, and the manpower [in these departments]. At the same time, some other departments may be deprioritized, and the people in those other departments will get impacted. But I don’t think you should worry if you will get laid off, because if you have a strong skill set and strong expertise, many other companies will recruit you right away. Boston, Bay Area, San Diego, Pennsylvania, and Carolina, are all biotech hotspots. There are hundreds of biotech companies and many big Pharmas in those places, so there are so many opportunities. Therefore, if you really want to transform what you learn from college and graduate school to drug discovery, want to do more translational medicine and any type of drug development to help the patients, then industry could be your path. But if you are more interested in basic science and enjoy an independent lab setting more, you should consider the path that can lead you to a faculty position."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you manage a team of super smart people and scientists?",
          "answer": "As I mentioned before, you have to work as a team in the industry, and all your team members are very brilliant scientists and physicians. You can imagine a meeting with 10 PhDs and MDs, because some of the team members are physicians. You might wonder why a physician would also be in the industry, and that is because there are two different tracks for MD as well. Once they get their medical degree, they can either be the physicians in the clinics and hospitals, or they can choose a career path in industry. In the industry, medical doctors will oversee the drugs that have the potential to move to phase 1 clinical trials. They need to lead the clinical development plan – which drug do we want to pursue for further clinical trials? What dose should you start to ensure the safety of the patients? They also need to communicate with the physicians in the hospital – Does this patient have a response [to the drug]? Why did they not have a response? Are there any safety signals? Could they do monotherapy or do they have to combine with other therapies? All those kinds of details. \n\n Back to your question about teamwork, just try to imagine many PhDs and MDs sitting in the same room as a team, and everybody has a different opinion. So, to be honest with you, it's a bit of a learning curve. It can be a challenge in the beginning, but it is actually also fun. Because medical doctors may think about the patients more, while research scientists like me will be thinking more about the biology, the mechanism, the science from the mouse study, monkey study and cell lines. So we must know each other and teach each other. Usually we do have a lot of disagreements and debates – just like in Congress. So this is how it happens in the industry, and it's not negative. For example, you may have a new innovative medicine and you have to decide whether the company should try that drug on lung cancer patients or on breast cancer patients. We have our own rationale based on the biology and our studies, while for clinical doctors, they think in terms of the reality – breast cancer patients and lung cancer patients have different standards of care treatments and different safety profiles, so we have to evaluate them together. Also, the commercial team will have a different perspective, because in industry we are not nonprofit. We need the revenue to do the research, and there is cost in the R&D process and the clinical trial. \n\n So there is a lot of disagreement and realignment [within the team]. The challenge is that there is no straight path forward. If you propose something, you may get different opinions, but the good thing is that you can get some ideas from other partner lines and you can revise your proposal. Eventually, being able to make a better plan will benefit the patients. Therefore, I regard it as a challenge but also a good opportunity to work as a team, and you also learn a lot from them because your expertise is different from theirs. If you don't work as a team, you only know about what you know in this field your entire life. But if you work with the team, you can learn the perspectives from the regulatory side, the commercial side, the legal side, and the clinical side, and you will know the big picture of drug discovery. So that's what I'm going to share with the potential intern candidate for the biotech/pharma track. What does the big picture look like? From the early in vitro study, to mouse study, to monkey study, how do we move forward the compound in the clinical trial?"
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you keep track of new papers in the field and deal with exploding amounts of industry information?",
          "answer": "I would suggest college students or graduate students, if you are really interested in the biotech industry, you can start to do online searching. There are many different kinds of biotech news, and people look at the news all the time. You can set up the email alert, either for a weekly news or a daily news, so you can try to get your foot in the door. You might see some news related to Pfizer, like their vaccine got approved by the FDA, and you can start thinking about why they've been approved, or think about their safety and efficacy. Then you can do the online searching for the safety and efficacy for the vaccine, and you can identify the research paper. For some news, if you scroll down to the bottom, there are some scientific journals, and you can click on that. One of the ways to understand those biotech firms is through the research paper. You can also just do online searching for drug discovery. Search in Google Scholar – there are some review papers that even very young scientists can understand, and you can also set up the email alert for that. \n\n Another way is trying to find your alumni. If you are interested in this, you can consult your professor or the postdoc, and they may know someone who went to the industry, so you can make a connection. Set up one-on-one meetings with them and introduce yourself. Try to find a mentor, and they will try to guide you and they may even help you to look at your resume. That will be very beneficial because everybody starts from zero just like me. I got rejected from different applications for the industry – I applied for almost 200 jobs before I got into the industry because I was just a fresh Ph.D. graduate. You might think that having a Ph.D. is cool. No. In industry, the majority of R&D scientists are Ph.D., and you are just another Ph.D. who doesn't have industry experience. If some of the companies do think, based on your Ph.D. training in academia, there's a need that they think you are a good fit so that you get an offer, that is your opportunity. So there are multiple ways – try to find a mentor. Set up the email alerts. Learn to understand some papers. Understand some news from Biotech. This would be the starting point."

          "question": "Tips for Becoming a Research Scientist",
          "answer": "Like I just said, try to explore the biotech news. Try to look for a mentor. And if you are interested, take some courses in college and graduate school which are more applicable to drug discovery. Some professors might also have experiences in the industry, so they can give you more insight, and that is how the course I took really motivated me to have a very strong passion, which eventually motivated me to pursue a Ph.D., which is another 5 year journey. You really need to have a very strong passion to pursue that. That's all my suggestion."

We can save the life of manufacturing workers by eliminating the use of those chemicals. \n\n On the industrial side, major problems like corrosion and wear occur. Many assets are corroded every year, and that is a 2.5 trillion-dollar problem.

          "answer": "The title of my degree was always mechanical engineering. I had a bachelor's, two master‘s, and one Ph.D., all in mechanical engineering. But, I think I am much more of a chemical engineer. My first master’s degree was related to aerospace engineering, while my second master’s was mainly biomedical and biomaterials. I was making anti-bacterial and specialty coatings. My Ph.D. was mainly chemical – even my Ph.D. advisor was not an engineer but a chemist. My other advisor was a microbiologist and an environmental engineer. On the personal side, I think what changed my attitude toward business life and everything else was my work experience for small companies from 2005 to 2009 and before I start my Ph.D. in 2009. Those companies shared an entrepreneurial environment. I had projects in 10 or 11 companies, and I was exposed to all sorts of different industries – the edible oil industry, sugar industry, power industry, you name it. Now when I started a company in 2015, I had to put on a whole different hat. I was less engaged in science and engineering but more in the sales and financial aspects of the business."

          "question": "In your eyes, what are the necessary qualities for someone to become a successful entrepreneur?",
          "answer" : "To me, it is mainly a matter of wanting to leave a good and big impact and have a vision. In the past 7 years, I just paid myself the plain salary. If I were looking for short-term gains, I could get a job at a large company and I would make 4-6 times what I made as salary during these years. The thing that matters is that you need to be able to think of it as a journey toward leaving a large impact. You have a vision that you really want to make a difference in the world. When it goes into operation, you need to be able to build a team. If you know how to deal with people, then you will know how to hire the right people who have the skills, and they will work with you."

The company has built this technology, and now I really need a senior person who has a lot of experience in sales. So, I try to recruit strong senior people and I will let them hire the rest of the people. \n\n But there are many senior people just like other experienced people. Among all these senior people, some of them have special drives. Some people really get to the point where they really want to do something big or different. Maybe they don't know how to start a company themselves. Maybe they don't want to take too much risk, but they still want to do something more than a day-to-day job. The first vice president we hired is about to retire, but when I met him, he said, “Look, I always wanted to start my own company. I never could take a risk like that.” I said, “you know, you're a very capable person. Why don't you join us?” And he came in, and that person alone is doing the work that a group of typical employees cannot."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are your thoughts on being an effective leader and keeping the team motivated for the long run?",
          "answer": "That's one thing I learned over the years: a leader should be the example. If there is hard work that must be done, he is the one who does it. If working over the weekend is sometimes needed, the leader is the one who does it first. He does not just order others to do that. \n\n I try not to ask people to follow a rule that I don't. In leadership, I have to set rules and standards, which should be clear to everybody. Communication is also very important. People want to make sure they are heard, not just being ordered to do this and that. When you are listening to them it shows that they are important. And if they are important, they will be more willing to look up to your leadership. Another important thing I found is that the startup CEO should spread a vision that a teammate has to understand. What is the main goal of our company? Why is this goal important? \n\n Empowering is also very important. Before empowering, you should make sure nobody ever puts anyone down. Years ago, I did not understand the impact of these principles. I used to get frustrated often. I think if a leader is powerful inside, that person naturally empowers other people. But if the person naturally is insecure or weak, then they may put other people down. So, empowerment comes from people who are self-made, powerful, and more internally cohesive. Leaders also become more powerful when they empower other people. That's how I experienced it because I made that mistake when I was younger and less experienced. \n\n Recruiting also plays a role because if you recruit the wrong people in the team, then all the things will go wrong. Even when you hire the wrong person, the way you deal with them is important."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you have any suggestions for addressing common roadblocks like lack of confidence and fear of failure?",
          "answer": "Well, one straightforward suggestion is to find a good mentor – somebody who can be honest with you, who can tell you the truth, and whom you trust. If no one tells you, you may never see it or you may learn it the hard way if you ever learn. \n\n The second thing goes back again to the value system of people. If the value system is only driven by people saying good stuff about you, or your vision is just to be a billionaire, to be famous, and things like that, then you will always need external sources to make you feel valuable. But if your value systems go a little differently, in my opinion, you see things differently. \n\n Another thing that I also want to tell you, is to have people around yourself that appreciate your growth. There are many things we don't know. If you are dealing with people who constantly compare you with someone much better than you, a lot of time that can negatively impact your confidence and gets you into a different mode of operation. But if you also have people that appreciate your growth – for example, last year you had no idea how to raise money, but now you raised a million – that is another very important part. Be appreciative of our growth. I always tell people that in my opinion, happiness is not a matter of having. Happiness is a matter of gaining. If you get to the highest place, I don't know if you're going to feel any happiness. But when you're moving up at a proper speed, you feel a sense of happiness. I was at 900 feet yesterday but now I am at 1000 feet and that is where I expect to be, and I believe that's the kind of mindset that we have to build inside for our souls. You need a mentor to help you set your goals and metrics and celebrate meeting the goals as you meet them. \n\n You don’t want to become an egoistic person, but you also don’t want to become a weak person and never appreciate your own value. So the key to being at the balance point is always having self-reflections, having somebody who gives you feedback, and somebody who believes in you. More importantly, have realistic but ambitious goals. Also, remember to celebrate small achievements. If you meet the milestone, even by a little bit, then go buy yourself a coffee or a gift or whatever. One thing that was missing in me is that I was constantly chasing the milestones. When I hit a milestone, I will immediately start looking at my next milestone. Don’t do this. Buy yourself an ice cream or buy for your teammates something appreciated. I think it's important to value our groups and be ambitious at the same time. Don't just go for a small thing but take steps towards your big goals and celebrate your success."

          "question": "Tips for Finding a Mentor",
          "answer": "I think asking for help is the first step. If you talk to me and if I don’t know that you want to hear my thoughts, it is highly unlikely for me to offer that to you. If somebody is admitting that I need help and I need to grow, people will try to help you – what do you mean by a mentor? What do you need? That's the beginning of it. During this thought process, you will start wondering and asking yourself what you really need. \n\n Secondly, use your network very well. Somebody says network is net worth, so use your network to connect yourself to people. Maybe I need somebody who can speak Chinese. Sometimes people will just know a potential candidate, so I always try to use my network. So, when I started my company, one of the alumni of my university invested in my company and I told him that I need a good business mentor to teach me how to develop a fundraising plan. Then he connected me to this person, made a good friend and that's how we found him. \n\n My third point, again, goes to sincerity, honesty, and thinking of what you really want to do. A good mentor will always want to help somebody figure out things or go toward the goal. The better you know what you want, the more relevant mentor you will find, and they can help you better. \n\n When I was a student, I really needed somebody to teach me something about bacteria. I went to LinkedIn and searched that. I found somebody in New York with relevant expertise. I emailed him. I told him what I wanted to do and how I found him, and that person answered my question without knowing who I am! So, ask for it."

          "answer": "Well, you know it depends on your goals. To develop your leadership skills, I think to try to be active in the college program. I suggest contributing to extracurricular activities, like being a member of some student groups. Try to take some leadership position learn to deal with people. For example, in your position, you might have to get some money from someone to buy pizza for the rest of the people, and these are the things that make you think of many aspects that you have never thought of. Set yourself into a place that forces you to ask questions – can I do it? Why can’t I do it? \n\n Number two, if they want to be professional engineers, go for an internship and don't stick to school only. When you go into an internship, the first thing you do is to sign an IP assignment. “What is an IP assignment? I've never seen any document like that.” Just getting into that environment immediately will already make you learn so much. If there are professional development courses in the school, take them. Even basic stuff, like how to write a professional lab notebook can impact the person who wants to hire you. If you want to start a company, then expose yourself to these environments. Many of the schools nowadays have an entrepreneurship competition. At least go there, sit there, and see what these people are doing. Listen to their pitch. I think these are the things people in school should do, and you should consider that as important, maybe even more important than whether they pass a course."

          "answer": "Bindu was born in India and she learned quickly that there was an emphasis in engineering and medicine. She decided to pursue engineering for multiple reasons: interest, family influence (dad and sister were both engineers), and a chance encounter. Bindu had always excelled in math and had a knack for solving problems, but in 8th grade, she first encountered a computer at school. In primary school, she knew of the existence of programming languages and electronics, but had little exposure to the field. However, since that fateful encounter, it felt as if she had found her career and has never looked back. Her journey started as a major in electrical engineering at Bangalore University but transferred into computer engineering. Since then, she has continued to be enthralled by technology and followed in the footsteps of her family to become an engineer. \n\n When Bindu was in her final undergraduate year, the dot-com era had just started and there was this internet explosion at the time. It was the perfect time to be hired for her first full-time job as a software engineer at Global R&D. She was quickly introduced to everything from new software to expanding her knowledge of coding. Bindu shared with me how important it is to find work experience outside of school as she had been thrown into the fire and was challenged early on at that position. She was lucky to have close mentors and experienced colleagues who recognized her hard work ethic and willingness to learn. They helped propel her career far quicker than she could have achieved herself and now serves as a director like her mentors before her. Lesson here is to always go the extra mile, as others will recognize your hard work and it will exponentially grow your skills. \n\n Earlier in her career, Bindu was convinced by a male colleague to start a software company specialized in connective technology as she was young and had no outside commitment other than work. This allowed her to commit her entire time to rising up the ranks and helped each of her first few start-ups go public. During this period of transition, she learned that you should never feel like you need to reach a destination, but instead be open to learning or in the case of software engineers building skill over years of hard work."

          "question": "In your view, what are some characteristics you appreciate working at a startup?",
          "answer" : "First, an idea that challenges the status quo. There is always a risk involved because there is no tangible result. However, Bindu believes that risk is something that has always attracted her to a company. Second, since a startup company requires a team of highly qualified individuals, they should not feel afraid to voice your opinion. It’s a significantly different environment from working in a Big Tech company with 3000 employees in one department because your voice and ideas are recognized. Third, you are responsible for many different roles within a startup. On one day you may be responsible for engineering; on the second day may be quality insurance; on the third day you may be troubleshooting for a client using your product. Fourth, the bureaucracy is very limited, so you do not have to be assigned to a ten-man team or get approval from five other departments. It lessens the hoops you must jump through and Bindu very much appreciates that. Finally, she appreciates the culture as start-ups offer a very casual and inviting work environment. These are all critical components that help her decide whether she would like to work at a particular start-up.\n\n Start-ups present many challenges in the work catalog, but the majority of employees who end up working for them embrace those challenges. Key characteristics that make up an employee at a start-up include the ability to be a self-starter. This means being able to jump-start a project or initiate work without anyone else having to inform you. Knowing your role is key in this situation as your knowledge from past work experience will be tested, but self-starters tend to flourish in these scenarios. Second, start-up employees tend to enjoy the freedom and ability to make their own decisions. Bindu goes on to explain how working in a large company means many tasks are assigned, and they do not offer the flexibility but rather maintain control to achieve overall success. A start-up company invites those who appreciate the freedom of working on their own tasks. Finally, an informal trait I noticed when talking with Bindu is that start-ups often have leaders who do not conform but are rather, in her own words, “rebels with a cause”. It's clear how a start-up’s work environment is better suited for her and others who share these traits."

          "question": "Software Engineering seems like a very popular career, and those who are working for larger software focused companies are motivated by the larger pay. What do you have to say against this sort of notion, and maybe describe how this obstacle may affect a start-ups success?",
          "answer": "If you were to join a start-up, then there will be many opportunities placed at your doorstep. However, it’s important to be realistic and realize that the end goal is to be acquired or IPO-ed by an investor. Yet, Bindu does not recommend us to take a job simply because you are guaranteed higher pay. Of course, financial stability is important, but she also said that a full-time job takes about one-third of your day. One-third of your life is spent at the office means you better enjoy your work or you will burn out sooner rather than later. Thus, Bindu emphasized that we should pick what we are passionate about, and then your commitment will determine how successful you will become."

        {
          "question": "Starting a software company can seem daunting to many, and typical roadblocks include struggles with confidence and a fear of failure. Do you have any suggestions to address these obstacles?",
          "answer": "Bindu reassured me that many of the companies have their struggles. Especially for start-ups, financial crunch can be the difference between life and death. For start-ups, there is often no machinery and financial stability is not guaranteed, so there is a great deal of risk going off to start a software start-up company. However, Bindu shared how she views each challenge as an opportunity working for a start-up. She took the time to share how one of her early start-ups in software engineering had all the finances covered, but the 9/11 attack resulted in supporters pulling all their finances from the company. Yet, Bindu knew that what they were building was way ahead of its time, and she moved to California only to find the same prototype they built at a showcase. They were able to get a deal with a party that was interested and saved the start-up from collapse. Bindu continues to share how difficult times finding finances will demoralize even senior employees as it lowers the chances for start-ups to be publicized. However, each time she encountered that hurdle she worked towards an IPO and got acquired for millions of dollars. Again, each challenge can be seen as an opportunity to grow."

        {
          "question": "Tips for International Students",
          "answer": "Bindu was most challenged by the language barrier. Her experience in the US was filled with miscommunications and a thick accent, as growing up in India meant she did not use English on a consistent basis. However, she noticed that places in the US are “melting pots” of cultures and many were accepting of non-native speakers. Something that remained consistent was that hard work was most valued, as this is stressed to the extreme in Asian cultures. Bindu learned quickly that communication was key: articulating details, using analogies, etc. She continues to say that in business culture, education is necessary to learn the technical points, but soft skills are vital to your success. In international countries, many of their schools do not teach these soft skills, which makes learning these skills on the fly very difficult. On the other hand, the US schools seem to teach students how to handle an argument, lead a debate, and master other soft skills before reaching higher education. Nevertheless, Bindu appreciates the freedom of being self-sufficient and enjoys the rights that come with being a green card user, despite the financial struggle she may have had early on."

          "question": "How would you describe your profession in your own words?",
          "answer": "My profession right now is working at Intel as a software test engineer. Part of my primary role is to make sure the hardware and software works properly before the release. Prior to Intel, I worked at a startup company called Barefoot Networks, and then before that, I was at Cisco for about 11 years. All these companies have a common industry and theme, which is network equipment. Basically, the products are related to testing on the router and switches, whether it’s in the enterprise network or in the data center network."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why did you choose to pursue this path?",
          "answer": "I went to high school in Cupertino, and my high school had very famous alumni. It mainly included Steve Jobs, so we used to have computer labs full of Mac computers and lots of tech donated by the Apple Company. And believe it or not, it’s also because I watched a movie about hackers. I thought it was really cool to help defend the network and be the network police. All of those are why I started looking into computer science, particularly the networking field. But gradually I felt that maybe it was too overwhelming to be a network police, and I found my other interests in creating a solution for customers and how all the devices are connected to each other, from the server to the Internet. So after graduation, I went to take a Cisco certification course to learn all the different networking protocols. For my first enterprise job, I landed with Cisco. That's how I started to learn more about the details of how to test different protocols, as well as how to use the computer science knowledge that I learned from university to help with manual testing. \n\n Manual testing involves a lot of time and human resources, and lots of times that testing could be repetitive. Let's say a new feature gets introduced. We usually would go through the testing cycle for the new feature, but eventually in the future we would need to test it across different new releases, so that's when we start needing to automate the testing. Early on, we used the TCL language for automation, but now the industry standard has moved to Python automation. It helps a lot because it could be the same protocol, but we are testing against different hardware or different software releases. So once we can have the same test case or test methodology, for the automation and script, we could put in a different device or different software release under test, and make sure that the same quality or the same profile works."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are some differences that you noticed along with the change in programming language?",
          "answer": "Going from TCL to Python is like going from C to C++. Traditionally lots of programs are written in C or in a more linear style of programming, and then eventually it's improved to an object-oriented type of programming. TCL is very easy to learn because its main purpose is for scripting. It's very simple, especially for CLI (Command Line Interface) testing. Basically you send a command and then you get some output. Then from the output, you parse through different interesting values and keys, and make sure that the output is as expected. Now, why did it change to Python? Python is a newer language and it's object-oriented. It has the advantage of more re-usability of the code. For example, there may be one feature you can write into the same object, and then you can provide different functions to test from the protocol itself."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much of what you learned in college was applicable for your job?",
          "answer" : "I’d say that now I use about 20% of the actual knowledge I learned in university, like from textbooks and lectures. But how to look for resources, how to look for information; those are the skills I still use today. In university, you learn the new technology and then you learn how to gather information, whether it’s from your professor, from your friend, or from the Internet. That skill is actually much more important than remembering all the different protocols or memorizing the formulas from the textbook."        
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you have any suggestions on how someone can take action and develop this skill?",
          "answer": "At the first job I had in Cisco, I was mainly doing network testing. But my boss actually asked me to write a tool to do a weekly status report, so the team could fill out the form and install that information in the database. That was something that I didn’t expect to do as a network tester. But the Bible says that we should honor those who are in leadership positions, and be humble and obey, as long as it's within God's word. So at that time, even though I felt that it sounded like a janitor's job to do this type of framework because it's not a part of my job description, I still went for it. \n\n So basically I went on Google and saw how to set up my SQL database, and how to write a Perl script, which I hadn’t learned before, and eventually built a tool to help with the test status report. In testing, we also have a bug report; whenever there is an issue with the code, we have a bug. Then there's also some bug trends that we have to analyze. So with that tool, it also helps with analyzing the incoming or outgoing bug trend, which helps my manager to plan better for the next release or project. It also helps him to better know how to allocate engineering resources in different projects. \n\n From that experience, I learned this language and how to build a database. It actually helped me to bless I Fly Young when there was a need, by using that skill to work on the website. So I feel that it was an experience where I learned to be humble and to not complain about what the manager is assigning me to do. You never know what skill or knowledge you may learn from that experience, and if you may be able to use it for your next project, next job, or even in serving other people."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is your favorite aspect of your job?",
          "answer": "To be honest, at one point in my career, I felt that a career was just a job. Sometimes I felt that as long as I could finish my assignments and finish all my tasks, that was it. So I had been struggling to find a passion in the career itself. In the first job that I had, I had a lot of passion; I wanted to pick up all these new technologies, I wanted to learn all the things that I had not learned before, I wanted to be the most efficient person in the team and help the team be successful. I’m not sure when, but at one point, that job had just become a job. It felt more like completing a task and taking the money to feed the family, and the days just went by. \n\n Another point is that I usually feel that I don't want to spend much time at my job, because I know that I want to serve God more. So I may use some of the work time to maybe prepare for Sunday school or home group messages, or to just get in touch with people. But I think in one of the teachings, I learned that we should not separate our faith from the [workplace], and that we should also be excelling in our [workplace], in our career, instead of just being a normal person that works. \n\n Joining CCE has also helped me because I've always refused to take responsibility. I feel that it's really hard for me to take the lead; because once you try to lead and be in a leadership position, whether in work or at church, there will be some responsibility, or other people that rely on you. But I feel that after joining CCE, my mindset has changed. I feel like God wants to raise me up. I guess he's trying to teach me to be a leader, not just because the position is a promotion, but it's more about being able to train more leaders or to train more people where I can pass on my experience to them. \n\n I do feel that there have been some changes within the last few years. Even though I have not put in so much effort at work, for some reason God still blessed me and raised me up into the team leader position. I guess it's also because I have a passion to help people, so whenever my teammates come ask me any questions, as long as it's within my reach and as long as I can answer them, I will try to go out and help people.\n\n In the past, I never wanted to lead a project because I refused to take that responsibility, but I feel that God wants to change me. Gradually, he wants me to take more responsibility and to train or mentor more people so I can be a blessing for the teammates. And then also in CCE, that's where I got called to be a mentor to the younger generation through my experiences, whether in career or through technical things like the different languages that you asked about. I feel that God has a plan in everyone's career, for it not just to be a job where you make money and feed your family, but there's purpose in a career to be a blessing to other people."
        },
        {
          "question": "Could you elaborate more on how you became involved in CCE and what your role is?",
          "answer": "So there was one conference that I attended, called the Level Up conference hosted by @Cloud. I'm not sure why I signed up. I think that it was during that period of time when I had a mindset change, when I started to feel that I wanted to bring my faith into my career and excel in my career. So that's why I signed up for the Level Up conference. During that conference, I saw lots of people who shared on the stage. They did have a passion for their career, but they're not consumed by their career. They actually use their career experience to bless all the people who are younger and fresher in their experience like I do. So that's when I saw that there's a need for giving and receiving, and this culture really resonated with me. \n\n So the track that I joined in @Cloud, the Level Up conference, is called Apostle Leadership, and it was led by Shengming and another brother. It was that time when I saw Shengming’s vision about the three ducks. If you saw the picture on either his presentation or his icon, there are three ducks. So there's one in front, there's one in the middle, and then there's one at the end, walking in a straight line. And he asked, “Who is the leader in this picture?” It could be the one that's leading in front, it could be the one in the middle, or it could be the one that's sitting in the back. So I felt that that was a very interesting discussion, because I would typically walk right at the very end, because I like to oversee everything, and I don't like to walk as the first one. I felt that during the discussion itself, God was also telling me, “Why don't you try to lead from the front?” \n\n So that's when I started to pray for courage, whether it’s in the mentorship position or taking the lead in part of the vision that CCE offers. I do feel that my passion is to help people and to serve the younger generation, even the children themselves, and that's why I started to join the CCE meetings and the platform. \n\n When Shengming asked me if I would like to be part of the Career Professional Council, I thought it was from the supporting position, because I was mainly doing I Fly Young support from the back end, like the G Suite set up and everything else for the online meetings. But I guess Shengming also saw something in me when he asked if I wanted to join. He saw my hesitation since I don't want to lead in the front. But I think that's exactly what God wants to mold and work on, and therefore I prayed about it and decided that, “OK, yeah, maybe I should try and take on more responsibility.” I believe that's why God created me to have a passion to work with the younger generation and blessing them. I believe I have a lot of experience that I want to share, and I have a lot of skills that I could pass on to people who are less experienced, from either a career or a technical perspective."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are some common or recurring problems you see in the younger people you mentor? Do you have recommendations on how to address them?",
          "answer": "Yeah, even during the CCE meeting, we shared about this. There are lots of mistakes that more experienced career professionals have made before, and we would like to see the younger folks not making them. For example, I used to be very shy in the beginning, and I used to not like to make any comments at all, but I gradually felt that it's not healthy for me or for the team because people would not be able to know what you're thinking or how to plan for things. \n\n Let’s say a project is delayed because of some technical challenges, but I don't want to speak out, I don't want to raise a flag and say “Oh, I'm having some issues, I need help.” Some people may just like to not say anything, but they will just try to figure things out themselves and try to be a stronger person, because no one wants to show their weakness. That's something that I would recommend to younger people, that it's okay to work as a team. Working by yourself will carry you somewhere, but it will not carry you all the way. Eventually, you will have to work with a team, eventually you will have to work with cross-functional teams. So the earlier that you can openly network with other people, even people from other teams or companies, the better. \n\n The other aspect is probably from the interview perspective. We do see that interviews are a very challenging topic for a lot of new grads, and that's why we had those CCE internship workshops. They don't know where to start to prepare or don't know how to prepare. As you spend more time in your career, you change from being an interviewee to an interviewer. You see different angles, and then we can share what the company or interviewer wants to see from an interviewee, whether it's communication skills, how confident you are, or if you're generally interested in the company or the positions. So I think focusing on these aspects will definitely help fresh grads or people who are starting to look for jobs."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you have any thoughts or suggestions on finding a suitable mentor?",
          "answer": "It's very interesting; I myself have not had a mentor. I do try to follow whoever is assigned as a leader for the project or even assigned as a leader in the church. But like I told you before, I have been trying to figure things out by myself. The good thing is that it helps me to strengthen my skills in Google searching; I become more efficient in looking for information. But it also isolates me to a project that I can only do by myself, and there are some projects that need a team to accomplish, ones I wouldn't have the time, resources, or manpower to do on my own. \n\n I also try to learn from people that I admire, whether it's at work or at church. One thing we talk about at church is discipleship. It's important for a person to be a disciple as well as a teacher at the same time, because once you become a teacher, you know how much you don't know. Being a mentor also helps me understand which area I need to build up more and strengthen. If I'm hungry, I won’t be able to feed other people in need, but if I can grow my crops and grow more fruit, then I have a lot more resources and I can provide for more people. \n\n Finding a good mentor depends on the individual. I would suggest finding someone that you feel mutually connected to and also someone that you look up to, because you know that you'll be able to build a good relationship with that person. But more importantly, once you are a mentee, I think it's also good that you become a mentor for someone else at the same time. That way you will know what you should seek from your mentor, you’ll know how much you have learned and gained, and you can provide for the mentee that's following you. \n\n So back to that 3 ducks example. If you’re the middle duck, you have someone to follow and you’re leading someone from behind as well. If you keep receiving and learning, but you don't actually teach or pass it on to other people, you never know if you have that knowledge or that skill. But once you actually try to teach or train another person, you understand whether you know that subject matter thoroughly or not. Once you get into the mentor position, once you start to teach or pass on knowledge, you start to know what area, skill, or personal relationship you still need to equip more. That's when you know that you also want to have a mentor to help you out with those areas."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are your views on getting certifications? How important was your Cisco certification to your job, and how beneficial was it to your learning?",
          "answer": "Studying for certification gives you a goal, whether it's some skills you want to have, or certain technology you want to learn. It could be a Cisco certificate, some courses you take on Coursera, or maybe some other application, like Amazon AWS. It’s more practical in a way, since you can put it on your resume. That would definitely help in getting the first job or a very skill-specific job, but as you become more experienced in the industry, those certifications become less relevant. As you become more experienced in the industry, a lot more will be about how you networked with your previous colleagues and your reputation from a previous project or company. That is actually more valuable than certification or skills themselves. \n\n For example, for the start-up job that I landed in, I didn't actually look for it on a job site; I was contacted by another software developer manager. I worked in the test team and he worked on the software development as the director. So he saw that I was doing automation of a scaled testbed involving lots of servers. I used a clever way to automate that process so that it saves time configuring the different servers to setup or test with that amount of test gear. He was really impressed with that project, so when he went to a startup company, I guess they were trying to look for software test positions, and he thought about me. He reached out to me on LinkedIn and also contacted me on the phone. That's how I landed my first start-up job, and eventually it was acquired by Intel. \n\n Certification helps for concrete skills, and also helps for landing may be your first or second job, but at the end of the day, as you grow more experienced and as you work in different projects and different companies, the networking aspect becomes more important. It's all about who the people you know are and what your relationships with different teams and different colleagues are."
        },
        {
          "question": "Since you've worked at a startup and also later at Cisco, what do you think is the difference between startup culture and corporate culture? Which one would you recommend?",
          "answer": "It depends on the personality. So I started at Cisco, working in a large corporate company, and then I went to Barefoot Networks, a startup company, and then they got acquired by Intel, which is also a large corporate company. When you’re working in a large corporation, a lot of processes are already defined; there's a typical way of doing things, and there are already standard tools for doing your job. I guess it’s like working in a factory; you get assigned a station, then you learn how to do the job function, and how to control the equipment and the device. You're at a position and then just let things run; I feel that's how corporate works. If you try to introduce a new change or new processes, it typically takes a much longer time than at a start-up company. It will also take a lot more effort to change the company culture. I think it's geared towards people who want a more stable job or who don't like a lot of changes in their working method. They don't want to change anything; they just want to work. \n\n But for working in a startup company, you have to be someone open to do anything as needed. A lot of time in start-up companies, the process is not defined, there's no well-documentation. You often need to evaluate new tools or open source tools. You may spend a lot of time researching tools, equipment or products, looking for what would work well with our own product. So working in a startup is very dynamic, and exciting, because you are constantly learning new things. Being in a startup company also means that you work in a much smaller team, a smaller company, so you actually get to know a lot more people than in the corporate world. Maybe you could even talk to the CEO and have lunch with them. So I see that for a startup company, it's much better for people who are more ambitious and open to a dynamic work environment, and also for people who like to have daily challenges, who are not afraid of evaluating different things. So even if you were like a software test engineer, you may get assigned to do some other things that are not in your job profile. I actually learned more about the software development process in a start-up company than in a corporate company, because sometimes I have to also work from that perspective before I can type the code. \n\n But startup companies also may not be as stable, and the benefit may not be as good. In Silicon Valley, it's a common saying that only 1 out of 10 startups will work out, so you only have a one in ten chance of succeeding. \n\n Even so, I definitely recommend to younger people that if they want to try out a startup company, may as well try it as early as possible, because you have a lot less of a burden, whether it's a financial burden or family and kids burden. You get to grow a lot faster than in the corporate world, because you keep on absorbing new skills and you're much closer with your colleagues. You may even get to know the CEO, why they had the vision to create that company or develop that type of product or technology. So it's definitely very beneficial for younger people. But if you like a more stable job, the corporate world is probably a better fit. \n\n We all have to think about our own careers and what type of jobs we want to do. That's why there are so many different types of jobs and different company cultures, and there has to be one that fits your requirements. Different people have different goals, so minus the monetary needs, you want to pick a career that you love, and one you’ll be able to grow and excel in."

          "answer": "This generation now is very blessed because there's a wealth of information and resources online, whether it's on Google, YouTube, or open forums. That's a blessing, but that could also be a curse because we often have an information overload. So how do we figure out what's the right way to approach networking with people in the industry? I would recommend joining the CCE platform. This is one of the platforms that was created to network with career veterans to young professionals, newly grads, and even high schoolers. I do see that it's a very strong platform to create a network. You're not just trying to get something, but you're actually providing something, so it's a give and receive culture. \n\n Otherwise, it will be really hard. You can search for some information online, but the hit results are sometimes too overwhelming. You may get like 1000 results, and you don't know which one to go for, and each reading may even take around an hour. So it's very important to have a mentor to give general guidance on where to look for the information or to give suggestions on how to build a personal network, as well as a career network."

          "question": "Tips for STEM students",
          "answer": "For STEM students, there's 2-dimensional growth. You could grow wide, basically learning all the different subject matters, but you also want to learn from a system perspective. You could learn about different areas like physics, chemistry, electronics, where you learn from the width perspective. Or you can learn from the depth perspective, where your subject matter is of a very focused area, like how electrons work in a circuit or something like that. There's a need for generalists as well as experts. But if you're a generalist, I would suggest picking one or two subject matters to grow a little bit deeper on. Otherwise, you’ll only know the big picture, but there are specific details you may be missing out on. If you are an expert on something, I would suggest broadening up the horizon and learning from a bigger picture on how different technologies or different things work together.\n\n I'm a generalist myself, so I often feel that I'm not an expert enough in any of the things that I know; that's why this is also a challenge for me. I started to train myself to be more equipped in one or two programming languages, or even known protocols in the networking field. So at least I'm like an expert in that field, but I also know a whole bunch of different things, even from art or business or accounting. So it's actually good to be a generalist, but you also need to dig deep in one or two areas. \n\n So to summarize, you can be either a generalist or a specialist. If you are going for the generalist path, I would suggest you pick up one or two skills to grow deeper on. If you are a specialist, I would suggest to not only focus on that specialty you have, but also to try to expand, because it will benefit you. Once you see the bigger picture, then you can go even deeper. And then for generalists, if you can look at a lot of things, but you understand something in more detail, then you know much better how everything works together. \n\n For example, let's say you're designing a chip, an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). You may know how it works, but then in order to design that chip, you have to go all the way down to how different registers or gates work before we can come up with the big problem. But if you don't know the big product, then how do you design the small parts? So two types of people are needed; one is more on the system level, and the other one is more on the component level. But it would be good if the system-level people would get to learn more about the components, while the component designer would be able to learn more about how the general system works. Then they could be a benefit by designing the system and components to work better together. \n\n The other point is, once you look from the perspective of other teams, you could solve a lot of communication problems or even conflicts. Sometimes if you don't see it from the other person's perspective, sometimes the team doesn't function well together. So I do wish that each team or each person would be able to look at it from both big and small perspectives, and also from different angles. That way when you're designing a product, teamwork will be smoother. \n\n [This also brings back to my earlier point on preparing for an interview.] In the interview, of course, the technical perspective or skill would be a major chunk of it, but ultimately most teams or companies want to have someone that works well with them. You can spend some time training a person for new skills, but training a person to work better with the team is a much harder task. So I would strongly recommend not just focus on technical skills, but also try to learn a lot more about soft skills: how to work with people, how to have better communication, how to be more proactive, and how to work in a team. You can learn a lot of that in college or high school, because there are lots of team projects. That experience is definitely something that you can carry with you to your career, because no matter what company you go to, we have to work as a team."

          "question": "How would you describe yourself and what you're doing now professionally?",
          "answer": "Our area of focus is eCommerce. A lot of eCommerce owners start as a side job -- there’s actually no “eCommerce” profession yet, no major consumer goods, so it’s an interesting growing part of the business world. I’ve been doing it for 11 years, making products, creating value for customers, and fixing their problems. So, in overall business, I would say I am pretty experienced in problem solving."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you be more specific and describe what kinds of problems that you solved?",
          "answer": "When we started, I didn’t even know how to import or export consumer products, so I would get stuck there. All my products got held in customs, and I didn’t know how to get them out. That was a problem we had to solve. In addition, we had to solve capital problems because no one wanted to loan or invest in our consumer goods business. With no history, investors are scared of investing, because there’s too much risk that they’ll have to use all the cash on inventory. We also had to solve marketing issues; it’s not just about finding good products, but also how to sell the product. At the end of the day, any business has to solve problems with different perspectives. Do I look at this issue with an investor perspective, or a consumer perspective? We learned that my opinion is not always the answer, there are other people’s expectations out there. When we got stuck and didn’t know what to do, really believing in ourselves, that we were meant for this, helped us not give up. We’ve had many crises, like near bankruptcy, but we overcame them to even reach the top 2 sellers on Amazon. We’ve grown from zero to 120 employees. At first we were just ordinary people, with first time jobs and no background, but because we were professional and did what we needed to do, we’re not scared of any problems and are solid."

        {
          "question": "There are many things you have to learn on the fly to be an entrepreneur, and that could be an intimidating roadblocks to people who want to get into entrepreneurship. Could you share some of your insights and advice on how you addressed these roadblocks?",
          "answer": "Sure. So the thing is that, we can’t solve every problem, so we [first] categorize [our problem]. [Is] fear [the problem that we are facing]? Are we scared of trying it? Or do we really think we can do it? We call that faith or confidence -- in Christian terms it will be faith, and to nonbelievers we just use the word confidence, right? So I think it's really getting rid of the fear and really going to the visionaries stage. Do you think you can really do it when we start picturing? Sometimes, even though we don't have the capacity, we start picturing what it would be like and we start getting excited. [For example,] what do you think you would do if you win the lottery? When we think of the lottery, we start smiling and we're like, ‘Oh my gosh. I can win the lottery.” Similarly, we start imagining when we're solving a problem. A lot of people don't imagine what it would be like after you solve it, but we start setting that as the goal. Like making a goal for a problem, going backwards and not being afraid of failure because the plan doesn't always work. \n\n The key thing was the way we treat failure. Do we treat failure like a failure or do we treat failure as learning? As long as we’re treating failure as the fuel or steps or learning, then there is no “failure”. We'd learn as much as we can and share the learning. Every time we learn, I think our perspective gets bigger. Sometimes, God is trying to teach us. Every failure for us has a meaning, so we try to treat failures as learning. [With that mindset,] the journey becomes more enjoyable -- we try to tackle as many problems, possibly learn and enjoy it because it's good muscle for us at the end of day, and we just take it a step at a time. \n\n The other thing is, sometimes we have to accept the door being closed [by the Lord]. Sometimes we may think, “oh, if we do this plan then we can do that”, or “if I get this partner we can get big deals.” Sometimes it just doesn't work, and we have to accept that it is not meant for us right now, and maybe there is a different way. Even though we actually had the power to force open the door and get that deal if we really wanted to, sometimes God doesn't want that. Every choice that we make has a consequence or reward. Maybe we can force open the door and get whatever we want, but eventually we [may] feel the [internal] conflict. So I think these days, we try to make it more peaceful, natural and not forceful. When we include God [in our decision making], problem solving becomes more natural and enjoyable. We may think we are stronger than Him or think we are more capable, but that leads to feeling lonely later down the road. So we try to ask [Him] a lot. We are faith-based business, and God always leads us to every choice we make. When we include Him, we become more mature and we get to learn when we're in control versus when we want Him to control stuff."

          "question": "What is the driving force behind your work? What makes you passionate and decide to pursue entrepreneurship, and particularly in eCommerce?",
          "answer" : "I think what drives me is the journey of faith. I learned a lot about why God mentions faith so much in the Bible. On my journey and others’, a lot of people forget what God does for them, or the help they receive. I’m really grateful for the change that happened in my life before and after this entrepreneurship. Before, I had nothing, even near bankrupt. I didn’t have a working permit, so I was basically illegal. I wasn’t actually good at anything, and my grades were pretty bad. I really felt like I was nothing, but now I’m completely changed. I can take care of the people I care about, and there are a lot of people who believe in me. I really believe that everything that happened was 100% through God, because I alone just wasn’t capable. So my driving force is that I owe Him my life. I remember what he did for me. I remember who I was. I remember the things that I overcame.\n\n Thankfully, through that journey I learned His heart, and how much He wants people to have faith in Him. As much as I appreciate the people who believe in me, I learned how much it means [to God] when we believe in Him. You get to appreciate people who believe in you more than you believe in yourself. I think it is a very encouraging feeling that God wants to have a relationship with us, so I really believed in him and actually appreciated him. There’s this idea that God doesn’t pick the most qualified or perfect people, but qualifies the called instead. As long as you believe your call, you don’t have to be qualified or perfect. I really think my journey is a testimony to that, because I was nothing close to perfect. I was able to see through him and the business, it's pretty amazing because I wouldn't have thought of all these achievements or these ideas. A lot of the time, I really didn't come with the idea. It was like, it happened, and God opened the door. At the end of the day, [I just want to] remember what He did for me and know that I owe Him everything."        
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you share some examples of how your faith in God contributes to your work?",
          "answer": "You know it’s God when you get ideas that you never could have thought of on your own. You know who you are, you know how smart you are. Ideas where you think, “wow, this definitely isn’t mine,” happen when you ask Him. There’s a lot in asking God for help and for blessing, and then actually acting on what he gives. \n\n At one point, we didn’t have any money in the business, so we had to close many, many times. Every other month or so, we were going to go bankrupt, but God would provide investment opportunities that kept us going. We wouldn’t be doing well, but we weren’t in fear, because God took care of us so many times. So we diligently and faithfully act as if we’re not going to close, because we didn’t get this far to close. Believe you’re on the journey; you’re here to impact. As long as you’re prepared and act faithfully, God gives opportunities. You know it’s God, because we didn’t send that email or make that call; we didn’t ask other people for anything, we only asked God. Then these things would come and keep us alive. \n\n What was really helpful was knowing when it was God versus when it was you. It’s important because you have to glorify God when you know it’s God. Don’t take his credit. Tell people that there were things we did right, but it wasn’t you who made that call, it was really God. We might be afraid of how people will receive it, but just boldly saying that makes a huge difference."
        },
        {
          "question": "What kind of people do you look for to join your team? What are characteristics for people who want to succeed in a startup or entrepreneurship environment?",
          "answer": "In our company, we look for people who know how to be thankful. A lot of people are just complaining about life in general, from the smallest to the biggest things. We’re drawn to complaining, so it’s very rare to find thankful people who make the most out of potential moments of complaint. It’s finding meaning in a bad situation, and deciding to be thankful. Deciding to be thankful when a bad thing happens to you is actually an active faith, and we look for that because we like to serve. We really care about serving others, and we expect you to serve as well. If you don’t know how to be thankful, you’re forcefully serving, and it’s not coming from you. Thankful people also create good energy and positivity. They also remember what they received and what we taught them. \n\n The second thing we look at is how self-centered you are. There are very egocentric people that only talk about themselves when they’re in a group, and they don’t ask how others are doing. We don’t like working with these people, because when they solve problems, they only look at it from their perspective. They don’t have the listening skills to understand and feel emotions towards customers or partners. Very self-centered people can’t see beyond themselves, so we’re not attracted to that. \n\n The third thing would be proactive and reactive action. We’re naturally wired to want to follow, but instead of being in an environment where you follow, can you be an environment where people will want to follow you? Even if they’re new, there are proactive people who are constantly asking. Asking itself isn’t wanting to follow, it’s wanting to observe, and you’re creating a shift in the energy. When you’re being thankful, serving, asking, and doing, as a new person, you create lots of positive energy for the existing people. Then we tend to shift to that person. We see the potential in them, we want to grow them, and we believe that they’ll create a good environment for others to constantly multiply in. We care more about wanting to grow, change and impact, and a little less about the skill sets. Of course, we need a certain amount of those skill sets, but we were people with huge drive, not just skill sets. So we believe in the environment you create first, and the skill you have second. \n\n We also like people with good habits. Habits are very hard to break. We try to hire based on [the] environment [they create] or [their] habits, because through that the work can be learned. We can [always] figure out [the issues if it is just the lack of] the skills, but it’s a lot harder to [figure things out if the problem comes from the wrong] environment [they create] or [the lack of good] habits."

          "question": "The giving and receiving and positivity of your company culture fits very well with CCE’s mission as well! That’s a different perspective, focusing on the culture and people, which is really important since that’s who you interact with daily.",
          "answer": "Yeah. I just want to add a little bit. These are the things that will help us find who’s the right person for us. There have to be two things: the right person and the right seat. It’s not the right skill; it’s the right seat. If you know it’s the right person, we have to move them around to find what matches them in terms of skill set and the role itself. A wrong person doesn’t fit in any seat though, and we have to get them out of the company. They’re going to be a cancer to the company, and it’s just not going to work. It has to be the right person first, and if they’re right, there’s a chance we can find a different role or seat for them. That’s a lot easier of a fix than trying to make a wrong person right; it just doesn’t work. Shengming mentioned something I really liked, which is that we value picking the right soil. If it’s the right soil, it’ll grow really well. But if it’s just totally the wrong soil, even the best seed won’t grow in it. But sometimes, even giving a little bit in the right soil will grow a lot.\n\n One person at our company was just like that. We gave them a little information, and he absorbed everything. We don’t have to give 20 hours of training, just a little, and he actually makes more out of what we learned."

        {
          "question": "How do you manage to balance entrepreneurship with your own personal life?",
          "answer": "I’m actually pretty bad at it. In the past I would do everything that came into my lap, so the only choice was to sleep less and just do more, but I learned later that we get burnt out really quick. So I think we have to find what we’re weak at, and start making partners or hiring the right people that will cover those weaknesses. Now we try to do what’s impactful, and you do that by not making it perfect, so we can keep moving. \n\n A lot of people want it to be perfect, but mini-progresses are what’s important. There’s this concept I really like that Andrew Wilkinson shared. People try to make a car, but to make a car, you need the frame, the engine, the pipes, the wheels, and after you’re finished, then you can go. Instead of that, what worked for us was to make a skateboard, then a scooter, then a bike, then a car. You want to make progress as you go, instead of trying to make it perfect. We get overwhelmed when we do things that aren’t impactful, so we don’t make progress. We have to make mini progresses to get data; we fail and we fix. We need time to go through cycles of learning instead of ending up making one big fat failure. So instead of making a bold break, we should scale it down to a smaller version, so we can learn and keep making a more progressive learning path. \n\n It’s also important to delegate as you go. One thing we learned is if you try to do everything yourself, you’re not going to get anywhere; you could go far, but not further. Knowing how to get there with people was key to getting there faster. People might say working with other people will slow them down, and that may be true, but you can’t get far without it. So we spent time training, teaching, and trying to find people that are like us. \n\n Another thing that happened with time was that I cut off a lot of people in my life, and created a circle around the people that helped me. It was painful in the beginning, but you have to surround yourself with the right people. I think we’ve all heard that from somewhere, but I didn’t listen to it. I really valued every relationship I had, but I realized there were some that slowed me down a lot. Or if you spend less time with them, you don’t have to cut ties completely, and then you can visit or help them back. To give you an extreme example, I had to cut my relationship with my family, because they were really hurting me. But now I’m really close with them, and we’re way closer than before. All the scars are healed and everything is much better. \n\n Knowing how to do that, delegating and being with the right people, is very helpful and balancing. If you’re tired, just don’t do work, and do what would re-energize you. Sometimes people say I’m a workaholic, and even though work makes me happy, if I knew I was getting in over my head, I have to stop. If you know something’s good for you, and you don’t want to do it, most of the time you should do it. Healthy food normally isn’t super tasty, but you need to eat it. I try to focus on what I have to force myself to do. We naturally tend towards comfort and laziness, but cutting those and doing what’s good for you, even if it’s painful, really helps to get the balance we actually want. \n\n One thing we teach at our company is called “counter.” For example, we really care about giving back, but how much are we really doing to give back? So here is where we counter: “we know we care, but we’re not doing it. So we’re going to do it.” We analyze ourselves, and help analyze other people. For example, “I know you care about working out, but you’re not doing it, so let’s find a way where you’re going to work out.” So with “counter”, we try to practice the healthy things that help us. Other people don’t even have to ask you what you do and don’t need to do, because if you think about it, we already know how to counter ourselves, so we just need to focus on getting that balance."

          "question": "Tips for International Students",
          "answer": "I was born in Korea but went to kindergarten in Australia, elementary in Brazil, and then middle school in Korea. I went to high school in the US, but in between I went back and forth to Korea. So on average, it was rare for me to be in one place for more than two or three years. It was usually one to two, and then we kept moving to different places, because of my father’s job as an international trader. So I did have an identity crisis, as well as a language problem. It was hard for me to make friends I’d get used to. So when we went to the states, I asked my dad, “I wanna stop moving, I wanna settle down and make friends.” But since I was young, I don’t think I knew what I was asking. For us to stop moving, he would have to quit his job, and that would make us illegal. So we came into the states legally, and then became illegal. \n\n I was able to go to public school and graduate from college without a Social Security number, but I couldn’t work without one. I was trying to be a dentist, and I didn’t know I couldn’t be one until later in college. That’s when I started working 5 jobs, like as a waiter or in a warehouse; any jobs that would pay me, since I couldn’t get a legitimate job. That led me to start a business. I had to pay a ton of taxes, but I could still start one without a social security number.\n\n There’s always a way. I could have made an excuse out of the situation, but there’s always a way, if you just don’t give up. Like I said earlier, believing you are meant for something, and that you didn’t come this far to not have an opportunity, makes your story and your faith stronger. It makes you more capable, because you overcame more than what others had to. It’s a good challenge to have, and you’ll be a testimony to not having any excuses. I really think the people who overcome more will be more successful in general. The more issues, the better the chances. \n\n I was also really bad at words, but if you can’t speak, you can’t be a CEO, right? So there were a lot of obstacles for me; I was Asian, I didn’t have a Social Security number, etc. But it didn’t matter; those were just opportunities for me to find a different path. I think that’s what made us rely on God more, since we couldn’t rely on the benefits. We had nothing which we could have done by ourselves, so we just had to keep asking God; there were no other options. The door He opened was better than the loan, it was better than anything. There’s always a way out. Asking God first and acting on what you asked is better than just having privileges. \n\n The first time God helps you, it’s like, “wow! God, thank you!” But if he keeps doing that for many years, you just know he’s going to take care of you, and you become confident. Since God has opened so many doors for me, I’m more confident, and I don’t care if it doesn’t happen the way I want, because He always has a better door or strategy. Any opportunity or partnership you get will go peacefully, because of what I call, a bold, humble confidence. You don’t need to be cocky, but you have to have extreme confidence; it is or it isn’t. Faith and confidence align. With that, even if you’re a new person in a new place, that can still be an environment where you can make a difference. People can feel that positive energy and they’ll be attracted to it. \n\n Sometimes people will just have things they want to look for, and if you don’t fit that criteria, you don’t have to be there; there might be a better place. Just know that you are more than enough; you are chosen by God, and you came here not to fail, but to make a difference. Have that confidence. People should look for you, not you looking for where you want to go. It’s a big shift, but I really believe in that. After seeing what He did for me for so many years and even to other people, I see successful people having that confidence and having that super strong relationship with God. They don’t always come from a huge successful background; normally it’s the opposite. So just have that bold, humble confidence."

          "question": "Tips for People Interested in eCommerce or Entrepreneurship",
          "answer": "If you’re interested, I really recommend pursuing entrepreneurship. You get to find a version of you you never thought you had. It’s like being a parent, but fast-tracked 20 years or so if you’re young. Taking care of employees is kind of like raising a kid, so I started raising kids, my business, when I was 25. You learn to be mature and a leader, because you have to do business. Even if you hired people of a similar age, you just naturally mature faster in your position. You can’t act dumb, you can’t act stupid, and you know that because people get hurt. You become more aware, more responsible, and you get to learn the necessary survival skills. You don’t have to have a big business, but you learn so much in that position that you wouldn’t get in any other job. You might if you’re high up in a different company, but with entrepreneurship, you get to see all of it; you face reality, and you get that raw experience. \n\n You’re on your own, but you just can’t do it alone, so I think that’s an opportunity for you to meet God. You get to experience and be with Him a lot more, and you just became this version of you faster than any other job. \n\n eCommerce is interesting compared to others. For restaurants you need a recipe, to do any other business you need cash. But with eCommerce, you just need the right product and have a few customers. You can start it as a side thing, then make it into a main thing. You don’t have to know code, you don’t have to know design; there’s a way to start without being perfect. You can learn as you go on how to be better and how to make an impact. That’s why I’m still in eCommerce. Now I’m trying to help other eCommerce owners get to the next level, because I know they can’t do everything on their own for long. \n\n So for entrepreneurship, first, you get the experience, but if the business does really well, you’ll get paid more than any other job. What I would tell my past self and every entrepreneur is to run a business like you’re going to exit. When you exit, you generate a lot of wealth. And to exit, you have to run the business clean, you have to make it investable, and not make yourself the focus of the business. Buyers like businesses where they’re hands-off, so they’re basically buying cash flow. To be hands-off, you have to know how to systematize. So with your exit in mind, you would run a standard of a good, healthy business, and when you exit, you basically get paid a couple years up front. If it’s a 4x exit, it means you fast-tracked four years. Then as you constantly build and exit businesses, you’re saving five, ten, twenty years of your life, fast-tracking faster than anyone else. \n\n I’m in my 11th year now, but I didn’t know all that before. A lot of people told us to expedite when we were super successful, but I didn’t see why we should exit when we’re doing well. But then the debt crisis hit, so you never know what will happen. It’s like when you go to Vegas; you’re not going to want to leave the table when you made the most. But I think exiting is helpful, and when you do, you can really serve the people you like. You could buy Ferraris, but the biggest happiness is when you get to help others in a way where you would have never thought you could help. Definitely give back to God as well, and He will bless you even more. \n\n Rick Warren’s testimony is huge. He gives back 90% and lives off of 10%, but his 10% is so big. He constantly practices giving and giving, but he also receives. He keeps getting, because God can trust him in serving others. With entrepreneurship, you’re creating your own vision. If you put God into that formula, you’ll see things you would have never seen before, and become some who you would never have thought you could become. We have our own choice, and we’re not building someone else’s empire. We get to build a part of God’s empire."
        },
        {
          "question": "Could you give a quick definition of what you mean by “exit”?",
          "answer": "Exiting means selling your business. In the US, it’s in terms of profit. Depending on the trend or healthiness of your company, businesses like software companies can be over 10X, meaning you get 10 times of one year’s profit upfront. Simply put, it’s annual profit times whatever multiple. If your trend is up and down, then your multiple is going to go lower. If your trend is flat, then you’ll get a little lower. If your trend is very attractive, then you get more. There are different ways to value businesses, but in eCommerce it’s 3-6, and it’s going up every year, since eCommerce is getting more and more popular. Previously there was no way for ecommerce to exit, but now there is. There’re always exits for software companies though.\n\n Exiting could also include fundraising. When there’s fundraising, you can exit your shares partially, and you don’t have to sell the whole thing. Even restaurants can exit. Just make your trend healthy and stable, have a consistent customer base, and you can exit 2-4X, and fast-track. \n\n If you get really good at it, you’ll realize you’re good at problem solving in any business, it’s all somewhat similar. It’s about the environment, the management skills, the organization, making the books clean, and knowing how to market. I would perfect one industry, and then go to other industries. It’s like buying a house, knowing how to fix it, then selling it. As long as you know how to fix the house, you could buy any house in the world. That’s what I call problem solving. If you know how to fix it, you can fix any business."

          "question": "Can you share a little bit about yourself?",
          "answer": "Sure! I grew up in Taiwan, then came to the US for college. I studied at Ohio State, then later on I got my master’s at the University of Michigan. Throughout my student career, I mostly focused on electrical engineering and computer science. When I graduated and actually started my career, it was 2008. It was a time of financial crisis, so it was pretty hard to find a job. I had to do a complete pivot from what I was studying, and I actually started my first job in sales, focusing on networking. I joined Cisco System, one of the leading vendors for networking, and I was in a part of the sales associate program. That’s where I started my career in the tech industry. \n\n I did a couple of years of sales, then pivoted to a more technical role as a technical marketing engineer (TME). The interesting part of a sales engineer is that we go very broad but pretty shallow in each area. There were so many interesting areas in technology, like security, data center, cloud, and I wanted to pick one area to really dive deep into. That’s why I became a TME, and I chose to focus on data center. \n\n After I did that for a couple of years as well, I realized that I'm really interested in the business side. As a technical person, a lot of the time I wouldn’t get involved with how customers make decisions or how we take the product to the customer. The technical folks would usually come in after the sale was made. That’s where I really got interested, so I switched from a technical role to the product manager (PM) role, which is more focused on business. \n\n In a nutshell, the product manager is like a mini-CEO. A CEO owns the company strategy execution and the result. Similarly, I will be responsible for pretty much everything about a product or product line within the group. That includes initial steps like identifying market opportunities and finding where the product market fit is. How do we build an MVP (minimum viable product)? Where will we be able to get the MVP version to the customer? What are some of the future features that we should make? How do we scale from the MVP to more like a V1, V2? How do we bring this product to the overall market; not just the pilot customer, but for the larger enterprises out there? I’ve focused my career mostly on the B-to-B, the business to business, not so much the product from business to consumer. \n\n I worked as a product manager for a couple of years. Then I joined AWS about four years ago, because I’m really from a data center perspective. Cloud is the future; everybody is moving to it. [After joining AWS,] I’ve been doing similar things as a product manager, but blended with some of the sales skills I had in the past. It’s a blended role of developing a product with the engineering team and working with the sales team to bring it to market and ramp up the revenue."

        {
          "question": "Can you talk more about what your specific role is as a product manager in AWS?",
          "answer": "A unique feature of being a product manager at AWS is that we own what we call product definition. This is asking the question of what we want to build. The product manager gets that initial idea through market research or getting feedback from existing customers. If they recommend we build something, and we see enough traction on the same request, then we know it is something we should invest in and build. \n\n Once we get a sense of what the customer wants, we go back with the engineering team. We, as the product manager, specifically write a document called PR-FAQ (press release frequently asked questions), which basically defines what the product is, hence product definition. Other organizations might call it PRD, which stands for product requirements documents. The very important thing that product managers do is understanding the prioritization. The customers will always ask for maybe 10 features they want to have, but we have to work with them to understand their ranking from one to ten. A lot of the time we don’t have the resources or time to build all ten, so we have to prioritize. We use the term P0 to describe features [or items with the highest priority], meaning that we cannot launch the products without it. So out of the ten features, how many are P0 functionalities? What’s the cost of building them? It’s critical for the product manager to figure this out, so we can help the engineers build the correct MVP with the initial customer traction. In the next iteration, like the V1 and V2, we can build beyond P0 to P1, P2, and P3, the later priority features. \n\n The product manager also has to work with the sales team. First we have to educate the sales team about what we’re building: what it does, how it benefits the customer, and the outcome they can expect to have. Actually, a lot of the time it’s the product manager who’s selling the product to the pilot customers. We show the benefit to the customer, they’ll test it, and if they like it, they’ll adopt the feature or product. After the product launch, we need to figure out how to scale the product. As a single product manager, I can’t talk to all the customers. I have to enable our [sales] team to act like me and to be able to sell the product. We also need to think about our strategy for scaling the product. We could go to the sales team, the partners, and maybe even other channels. There’s a lot of thinking about business strategy and how to grow revenue. We work with the engineering team to build the product and with the sales and marketing team to scale the product. We’re responsible for its success or failure overall; if it does well, we get the glory, but if it fails, we get all the blame too."
        },
        {
          "question": "What motivates you to continue working as a product manager?",
          "answer": "[People in AWS share a unique mentality. Although] we’re not at the same level as a lot of startups, we often operate like a startup, meaning that we’re early vision. We have the early vision of the new product or service we should be building, or a major enhancement for an existing service or feature to make for our customer. I have the vision of where the product market fit will be, then I execute it, and the customers adopt the product. Not only will we be able to bring in revenue, but the customer overall satisfaction with AWS increases. Being able to visualize and translate what was just in my head into execution is typically what motivates me the most. A product manager is essentially a builder, and you have to enjoy building things up from scratch."
        },
        {
          "question": "What made you switch from engineering to product managing? What interested you about it, compared to engineering?",
          "answer" : "Product managers and engineers share some similar characteristics; they identify and solve a problem by design or implementation. However, product managers have the additional consideration of the business side. If you look at a lot of the tech industry, the product that’s really successful at the end might not have the best tech from an engineering point of view, but it’s the best in combining the engineering and business sides. What a product manager considers is, “how do I find a market fit where I can build a good enough engineering product?” Once I have the initial customer and can scale, I can continue to refine my product and make it better. \n\n It’s a different mindset from an engineer, where we always want to build the best: the best code, the best hardware, or the best car. But from a product manager perspective, there’s a trade-off between time and what we build. What I’m interested in is finding the right balance between a good enough product and getting enough initial customers."

        {
          "question": "I noticed that you also work with Amazon Sage Maker. Can you share your experience on that as well?",
          "answer": "Machine learning (ML) is kind of a buzzword. Most startups today will tag themselves with machine learning or AI to some degree, but machine learning is still in its infancy stage, meaning there’s a lot of open source things out there. A lot of customers can stitch it together to make it work, in a DIY style, and there are many different standards across companies on how they do AI-ML. This is where we think Amazon Sage Maker can help. Like how AWS was popular among enterprises, the value proposition for Cloud is to help offload undifferentiated work so you don’t have to manage the server. You don’t have to own the data center, or pay for power and cooling; we manage all that for you. We provide the infrastructure or data center to the customer where they can dynamically adjust it based on their business need. \n\n Similar benefits apply to Sage Maker. Customers are interested in building the model, validating it, then using the model they’ve validated to forecast fraud detections and increase their business value. But to achieve that stage, the customer has to build a lot of things themselves today, which are undifferentiated. They have to build their own machine learning platform and standardize on their own best practice, which can create a lot of silo. Silo means that every department within that organization has a different practice. What Sage Maker is offering is a managed platform, meaning anything you don’t need to deal with. We manage all that in the cloud infrastructure, just like how we give you the benefits from the cloud as well. It really allows customers to just focus on spending their time and resources on building the model and algorithm, which is specific for their application."

        {
          "question": "What advice would you give to college students, particularly STEM majors, in pursuing product management?",
          "answer": "Most technical majors, statistics, or math majors definitely give you a very good base and all the necessary skills to do analysis and troubleshooting. What’s most important is developing ways to learn new things. Everyone is different, and you have to have your own methodology. This is especially important in the tech industry, where you will continuously need to learn something new. For example, I needed to learn Cloud, then Kubernetes, then AIML, and there’s always more on the horizon to learn. You also need to be able to do this outside of a classroom setting. In school, there’s always an agenda, a syllabus, or a professor with you, but you have to be able to develop the skills to really grasp and master new ideas on your own. In the tech industry or any other STEM major, you can’t just rely on the knowledge of your major, but you’ll have to have the framework to learn outside of it. \n\n Another way to prepare is to be broad in what GEC courses you take. A lot of the time people will just focus on their major, but I highly encourage taking courses outside of that. The product manager is a hybrid role; it is technical and business. We work with basically all the different aspects of the enterprise or organization, so taking some of the marketing or business courses will be essential to knowing these other functions. Understanding what other people do and having some of that background will certainly help a STEM student's success as a product manager in the future."
        },
        {
          "question": "It sounds like it’s very important to have that engineering mindset, but not so much the school mindset. For college students in general, what was your experience studying at Ohio State University? How did your undergraduate degree help you later on in your career?",
          "answer": "The number one thing college gave me is a framework to learn different things. I focused on my major as an electrical and computer engineer, but I also took a lot of different GEC. I had interest in courses like psychology, statistics, and even some of the languages, like Japanese. It really expanded my horizon and helped me develop that methodology to learn new things, which helps me in my work environment today. \n\n College also gave me confidence. My undergraduate journey was different from a lot of folks here. When I came to the US for college, I didn’t speak English, so there was definitely a steep learning curve for me. As a non-native speaker, overcoming the language barrier showed me that language shouldn’t be a blocker for me in school or in the workplace. That confidence continues to help me refine how I present, communicate, and connect with people."
        },
        {
          "question": "How did you overcome that language barrier?",
          "answer": "Back in college I was a member of the crew team. We would train everyday, so I spent maybe two hours a day with native speakers. I gradually picked up what they were saying, and even started to be able to read between the lines. That exposure to native speakers outside of the classroom really helped me to pick up the language. But even after I graduated, there was still a gap for me when I presented myself in English. For me, joining Toastmaster was a purposeful effort into polishing those skills. The pressure of working also helped me improve. If I can’t convince others in a sale, then it’s hard for me to keep my job. These ways really helped me overcome that barrier, especially being on the crew team; immersing myself on a daily basis definitely helped me get a jump start. \n\n I will also encourage STEM students to join a club, even if it doesn’t relate to your major. You’ll learn something that’s unexpected, and that could help your career down the road."

        {
          "question": "What was your experience pursuing an MBA, after working in engineering, sales, and product management for several years?",
          "answer": "So there are two avenues for an MBA. Typically people do an MBA after graduating; the golden timing is about three to five years afterwards. They might do consulting, investment banking, or financial services before then, but they’ve identified their career path and they want to go relatively quickly. Some folks want to be a product manager, so within those 3-5 years, they’ll apply to MBA. Most product managers in the enterprise world have an MBA, and while it’s not required, having it is definitely a big plus. \n\n The other route is for people who work for longer, like me. I worked for almost 10 years before pursuing my MBA, and I pursued that degree because I needed to know how to perform my daily job. Coming from an engineering and sales background, I didn’t have the training for pricing, modeling, or forecasting. A lot of folks that pursue an MBA much later in their career come from degrees unrelated to business, like engineering, law, or medicine. After working for a while, they’ll gradually switch to an executive or more business-oriented role, where they’ll learn the business discipline and new skills through the MBA."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you share your perspective or advice for college students who are not sure about their future directions?",
          "answer": "Data scientists and business analysts are pretty hot right now. There are thousands of these job postings, and it’s definitely a great way to get into the tech workspace. But I also encourage you to rotate around in your first couple of years. People can give you their feedback and experience, but it’s really up to you to experience it for yourself. It’ll take some time for you to really find where you want to launch your career. \n\n I didn’t find the product manager role until almost five years after I started working, and it took some trial and error. I tried sales and I liked it, but I knew I didn’t want my whole career to be sales. I tried technical marketing engineering, but again, that’s not something I feel like I will build my entire career upon. Then I tried product management, and I really liked it; it was something I could establish myself and launch my career upon. Some people may have a very direct mapping after they start a career, and that’s great. But I think the majority of folks need that trial and error to really find their right career path. Just because data science is hot doesn’t mean it’s for everybody, right?"
        },
        {
          "question": "Tips for Looking for First Job?",
          "answer": "My path was pretty direct; I just went to school career services. Typically most companies, including Amazon, will have a preferred education institution they work with. Every year, there will be an internship, then a full time job will come. You’ll need to be familiar with what your school offers regarding career services and what company typically works with your school. \n\n Another path is mentorship. I didn’t do it when I started my career, but I wish I could have. If you kind of know what you want to do in your future, a platform like CCE will connect you with a mentor who will be able to point you to those industry specific events, groups, or LinkedIn to join. You’ll get the exposure to see if you want to launch that career and what you need to do. For example, what certification do you need to have? What kind of courses do you need to take? \n\n Besides, note that certification is actually more important than a lot of people think. One of the reasons I was able to land my job at Cisco is because I happened to have a certification in networking, and that really helped me differentiate myself from all the other newly grads at the time. We all focus on our GPA in school, but we don’t spend much time tackling industry certification, right? That can be a pretty significant differentiation, especially in the first job or internship, since there’s no prior work experience to judge applicants by. Having certification will make your resume stand out pretty easily. \n\n Also, interviewing skills are amazingly useful. Any customer-facing role requires the skill to help the customer, but most importantly to extract the main idea. It’s not taught at school a lot of the time and the importance of this skill is often overlooked."

        {
          "question": "Tips for High School Students",
          "answer": "Taking AP courses in high school is one thing you can do. Computer science was harder for me in college because I never did coding in high school. We were taught all the theory when I grew up in Taiwan, but we never actually implemented coding. Getting hands-on experience at the high school level will be really helpful for college. I saw my peers understand what the professor wanted right away while I was still scratching my head, and it turns out they had AP computer science back in high school. If it’s an interest or major they want to pursue, trying out classes in high school will definitely give a much faster start in college."
        },
        {
          "question": "Tips for International Students",
          "answer": "They’re very fortunate in the current time to have so many online courses to take, like Coursera. Every online course has a different target audience, so do some research to see which ones are good for you. I recommend focusing on entry level and going with a brand name in terms of e-learning educators. When I came here from Taiwan, we didn’t have any of those resources. I just kept going to office hours and tried to figure things out; I think my TA really didn’t like me because I visited so often. The language and the computer science barrier was pretty hard. But international students in the 21st century have way more options, it’s just up to them to spend time and research. Maybe you only need to take a couple courses, or even just a couple of bootcamps, and you’ll get a pretty good idea of the language and computer skills needed."
        },
        {
          "question": "Career Advice for Students",
          "answer": "For folks interning in the tech industry, there are definitely different ways to be involved in it; you don’t really need to be in computer science. For every tech company, there’s a need for finance, marketing, sales, and engineering. At the early career stage, go broad. The only way to go broader is to try different roles in an organization or company. That will really help you find something you like, and then be able to build upon it over the course of the year. \n\n The worst case scenario is being stuck in a role you don’t enjoy, but you’re depending on that job as your career is moving forward. Something I always tell people is, you want to do something you like. It could be a lot of pressure, it could be a lot of stress. But at the end of the day that has to be something that motivates you and that you enjoy doing. If it is just an 8-to-5 job, that's not going to be something you feel satisfied with. As your career extends, the pay isn’t going to be the major motivation, but really the fulfilment. The accomplishment will really be where the job satisfaction comes from."

          "answer": "So it's called the principles of microeconomics, and it is probably my students’ first economics course. I’m super interested in the teaching side, but I also like to mentor students about their future career and what they’re passionate about. Teaching Intro to Microeconomics is very exciting because you get to work with so many young minds. Whenever someone wants to change majors, I always tell them the story of a student of mine. Many years ago when I was a grad student at Florida State University, I was teaching my own section of principles of microeconomics, and I met a really bright Korean American student, who was super interested in economics. After that class, she would always drop by my office hour and chat with me. Since we are both female and Asian, she felt very close to me. She was not an economics major back then but she later switched to economics. Several years later I got contacted by one of my former professors, and he said, “Li, do you know what happened to that student of yours? After she switched her major to economics, she really loved it. She graduated with a 4.0 GPA, and she ended up working for Google.” \n\n I like to tell my students that story because sometimes I feel like, out of the thousands of students I teach, if I can really make a difference in just one student's life, that will be enough. We all need mentors along the way, someone who's a few years ahead of you, who can give you some insight that will help you navigate. Sometimes we don't know for sure if our major is the thing that we want to do. Sometimes we don't know what kind of jobs will be available to us. So I always try to work with young minds because you can do a whole lot with young minds as you're guiding them along that path."

          "answer": "Actually I don't intentionally do so. What I’m doing is modeling the behavior. I am modeling my passion for Economics. We economists work with valuable data sets every day, and we try to find the opportunity costs. College students trying to navigate majors have so many options, but which do you pick? I think Asian parents encourage students to more profitable careers, but what we lose from that process is encouraging students to develop freedom and courage themselves. College is a place to explore your talents and interests, and figure out who you are."
        },
        {
          "question": "Following that thread, can you share more of how you decide to become an economics major?",
          "answer" : "Before I switched to economics, I was in a major called International Developmental Education. There, once you get your PhD, you go to developing countries and help them design an educational system that will work for minority or underprivileged students. However, life always throws you curveballs, and I didn't end up doing that thanks to a class taught by a life-changing professor to me. That professor was a Stanford graduate, a sociologist, and also a passionate economist. When I was an undergrad, I actually didn’t like economics. For example, the supply demand curve. Why are you shifting this curve and not that curve? It just does not make any sense to me back then. Only after I was around 23-year-old did I start seeing the beauty of economics and find it super-fascinating, and I started to take a lot of economics classes. Unfortunately, when I was about to defend my dissertation prospect, that professor passed away because of cancer. After that difficult period of time, I ended up giving up my dream of becoming an education specialist and switched over to economics. \n\n So that was a really long winding road and coming back to economics, but I think it benefited a lot for me. So I would actually encourage whoever is reading this, to really think about one thing -- if you made some long winding road and you feel like this is a diversion from whatever your goal is, or somehow you feel that you are doing something that on the surface is not consistent with your ultimate goal, it's okay. It is okay to fail, and it's okay to fail many times, because sometimes those experiences enrich your future. So back to my story, after I went through all that trouble and circled back to economics, guess what, I actually became one of the research stars in my cohort. It is not because I was better, but because my previous major gave me insight for new and different questions. I am interested in a lot of education policy issues that they didn’t get exposed to. When I was in my undergrad, I was able to see how teachers received their training, so when I started to work as an economist, I can approach those education policy research from different perspectives. Instead of just focusing on students, I also ask questions about teachers. Are we keeping teachers in the classrooms? Can we encourage them to become a teacher? How can we attract them into teaching? What do they have to give up, such as those industry jobs, if they decide to be a teacher? Had I started out being a straight up economics student, I would not be able to ask those questions. \n\n So my message to our readers is to not be afraid, and don’t worry too much if you make a mistake as a young person. Congratulate yourself on making mistakes because that's actually a great enriching experience. I think God has a plan for all of us, a great vision for each unique individual. Sometimes I have to listen to God's words and ask myself what God is trying to tell me. Sometimes I do get frustrated. For example, when my professor passed away during my PhD, I asked God, “ why'd you kick my professor away when I was a poor grad student? I was trying to struggle through the program, and I’ve made it so far. Why did you take him away?” I still remember my professor's funeral. I was crying. I was crying for him and also crying for myself, because it was so devastating. Because I was in a different country, and I had no idea what my future held, and now my professor was gone. And he was not just a professor, but also your friend and your great mentor. He had a natural passion for taking care of people, and he always brought pots of curry to feed students with. He had so much influence on me, and now as I became a professor, I think I inherited some of his teaching philosophy. I'm telling this story to encourage all of the readers out there -- don't get discouraged. My professor’s death was such a huge stumbling block in my career and it was so disheartening at that time. Now when I look back on it, it was still difficult, but somehow I made a pass through that, not because I was able to but because of my faith in the Lord, and I have a God with me. (Of course also with my friends and my husband, who was my boyfriend back then.) I just want to give a positive message to the readers that every setback can actually be a good thing."

          "answer": "Yes. I wanted to make sure that I’m not just telling a sad story, but because when young people are my age, you look back at the low points in your life and appreciate the people who made a difference. People need friends who support them, and friends who are out of their areas of expertise to open you to more experiences. \n\n I had one former student. He was an honors student and he was super self-motivated. After he graduated, he went to Southern Methodist University to get his master masters in economics. He was in his first semester of econometrics class, which is a very difficult math class, and he was not doing well. In that first semester, he would call me and asked, “Do you think I can do this?” I said, “yes, you can do this. Okay? For anybody you can do this. You're one of our best students. You can definitely do this.” But guess what? When he was taking his second sequence to that econometrics class, he did really well -- he did a stellar job, he entered into a competition, and his program actually introduced him to some local people and a local company. I also have some students who struggle in school, but even so, I’ll spotlight talents of theirs and support them. So sometimes we have to have that kind of person in our life and just tell us that, you can do this, and encourage us along this navigation process."

          "question": "Do you have any recommendations on how young people can find their support or their mentor?",
          "answer": "The church is a wonderful place to start searching for a mentor because that’s where you won’t be judged. Career counselors, high school teachers, and professors are also good options because they have networks in many industries. I think students sometimes overlook that, but they’ve taught hundreds and thousands of students prior to you, and they’re very familiar with the system because they have helped so many students to navigate that system. Also, talk to as many staff members as possible on your campus. People often ignore that we actually have wonderful staff members. From my experience, my university is a Hispanic serving institution. We have a lot of Hispanic and Latino staff members who are very good resources. Sometimes students have trouble putting food on their table, but they didn't know that we have a Bobcat pantry program. We also have the wardrobe program, where you can borrow some clothing like a suit and tie for an interview. There are lots of resources available, but you have to find the right people. Find someone who deeply cares about your success, who is willing to take the time and energy for you, and that person will be your mentor. \n\n Start networking when you’re in college. If you start when you begin looking for a job, that is already too late. It’s difficult to start during the freshmen and sophomore year, because you’re still learning to navigate the system. But in your junior or senior year, start talking to your professors, and also your parents. They may have good connections, and even if they don’t know the right kind of people, their friends might. \n\n You can also build your professional network by talking to the local community. I encourage everyone to volunteer at their church, local food pantries, or whatever else you are passionate about. You can do this in high school and college, and people will see your work ethic overtime. Earning a little income is also nice, but the more important thing is to know supervisory people who can provide references later on. \n\n Possible mentors can also be amongst your peers. Students a couple of years ahead of you can offer tips about which courses to take, what professors to avoid, and other valuable information. This is important to think about in your planning if you need a stellar GPA in the future, like for law or medical school. Like I said earlier, don’t be afraid if you make a few mistakes along the way, but this can help you avoid some towards your ultimate goal. \n\n So I just gave you a whole bunch of different places. I really think looking for a mentor is important in our modern days, and you can start that even in high school. However, you will have to try a few times before you find your mentor. Out of the whole list of people available, maybe only one is really invested in you, but that will be enough. You don’t need to have a mentor in every area, but rather find which one is passionate about your success. For example, I had one undergraduate who got an A in my class, but got A+s in her other courses. In that case, the other professors saw her potential and helped her get to where she wanted to be. \n\n Also, While it’s good to plan, it’s important to know that even if you didn’t get to where you wanted to be, don’t be discouraged. It’s life experience. God trains us to become better people, and gives us the perseverance to get through troubled times. As you’re building your network, you’re also building friendship and getting support. That’s especially important in high school and college, because these are formative years and you’re trying to find out who you are. We in the Chinese American community need to be cognizant of pressure being put on young people on getting it right the first time. Having a mentor, having friends, and having faith to support you is important in dealing with these kinds of mental health problems. Organizations like CCE can provide that kind of moral support network system. I hope you can see that from my story, you will be able to achieve your goals and be happy not just because you have money, but because you made a difference in someone else’s life."

          "question": "There was some media coverage on your research of how to train and retain high quality teachers throughout the country. Could you share more about that?",
          "answer": "I had worked for one year at Shaanxi Normal University with many student teachers, and was thinking of becoming a development specialist to work with low income kids and improve their educational opportunities. Actually this research agenda initially came as a compromise between me and my economics advisor, the first person I worked with at the Florida Department of Education 15-20 years ago. I had given my professor a list of ten potential dissertation topics, but he rejected all of them except my last topic, teacher shortage and training. However, I realized later on that I had always been interested in that topic and the work was actually very interesting. \n\n Traditionally a lot of teachers are trained through the college of education, but we were studying a specific program called the Robert Noyce Scholarship. This program was funded by the National Science Foundation, and wanted to recruit STEM majors to become K-12 teachers. The first part of the research question was to look at the national landscape and see how many math and science majors had become teachers in the past 15-20 years. The second part asked if the millions of dollars given to this program had made a difference in putting these teachers in high-need school districts, typically low-income schools or those with many African-American or Latino students. I was very excited because we’re working with many different universities, like the University of West Florida and University of Arlington, and with the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, D.C. \n\n Sometimes ideas take a while to get materialized, so this was around five to six years ago. We also had to apply four times before we got the funding for the project, so do not be afraid about applying for a scholarship and being rejected. We will all be discouraged, so put the rejection letter away, let it sit, and then go back to it in a week and see how you can improve yourself when you apply again. Grant applications like these are not easy, even though it might look that way when you get them. \n\n Even if you don’t get the job or the scholarship, take the opportunity to establish your network. Follow up and ask if they have any suggestions about how to improve and a general idea of what their ideal person looked like. An important skill for young people is to be able to communicate like this in a professional way. Don’t burn your bridges, because they might have a job in the future that you will be a good fit for. Make sure the established link is strong, learn, and build up that relationship. You could add them on LinkedIn; sometimes people share opportunities there, and then you’ll be in the know. It’s important to be able to wait. Don’t be discouraged, because you learn from failure. Always take opportunities that come at you, and you will succeed in the future for sure.\n\n It is important to have an open mind and a growth mindset, and I think that can also come from the faith. You can turn to prayer for improvement and opportunity. For example, you can say “God, I know this job you didn't give it to me, but tell me what I could do to improve.” Or sometimes you can even just say I can't do this. Please give me another opportunity. Because a lot of times God can do miracle work that humans cannot. We have our limitations. Mentors help, but ultimately, I believe our faith sustains us in our dark times."

It's not just stock markets -- that's finance. There are lots of research questions economists are asking, and there are a lot of social sciences. Economics is a lot like physics to a STEM major: very theoretical and a necessary class to take. Finance is very similar to engineering because engineering is very much an applied field, and finance is that. That being said, there are still lots of economists that are hired by Amazon and all these tech firms because we have a lot of very strong abilities to work with data, and our abilities to understand people’s purchasing behavior and decision-making process. \n\n Also look at what economists do. You can check out <a href=\"https://lifeng.wp.txstate.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">my website</a> and see if what I am researching are the kinds of questions you are interested in researching as well, because these are the difficult, challenging questions economists ask and spend a lifetime answering. If so, you will be a good candidate for an Econ major.\n\n If anyone is an Econ major or have any other questions, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:Li.Feng@txstate.edu\">email me</a>, and I’d be happy to chat."

There are many aspects of medicine that are very different from what ordinary people imagine a medical career to be. Uncovering the mysteries of the human brain or finding cures for cancer are not going to be a major part of your training, and your hospital volunteering experiences will be very different from a usual day as a healthcare worker. A huge aspect of medicine is having to communicate terrible news to an already shattered family. As you get more and more accustomed to the practical know-how of taking care of a patient, it is possible to become emotionally worn out by seemingly trivial details that actually become huge roadblocks to treatment flow, such as health insurance status, bed availability of post-acute care facilities, or missing family members who hold the power to make decisions for a patient. Think carefully before you apply to medical school, and remember to take care of yourself if you are admitted."

          "answer": "At Facebook, I'm working on a team trying to build a machine learning system to protect the content shared in the Facebook community, ensuring that the ads are high quality and don't violate fiscal policies. My daily work involves coding, machine learning, research, product design, and end-to-end solutions, including working with OPs, PMs, and engineers. I have worked in different companies like Google and Facebook and am interested in building machine-learning models and applying them to a scalable system that can solve real production problems. \n\n You can think of the end-to-end and back-end systems as the whole processing workflow. Production data, like user or ad data, includes data processing, feature extraction, and running machine learning models to make predictions. After you have the final decision, you show the final results to the users. The data was processed from the beginning into a system that leads to real impacts on the users. OPs have different roles, like engineers doing the coding and design. Program managers are called PMs and they work with engineers and the legal team to make sure the project will meet business requirements. They try to coordinate on gathering resources allocated between engineers. For example, we have a team of end reviewers. If a machine learning model predicts that an ad is violating some policies, the machine learning model can alert human reviewers to check whether the ad is selling a counterfeit product, or scamming. Using this information, you can decide whether this content can be posted on Facebook or not. If we're not sure, we can have third parties or invite reviewers to perform a final check and decide whether this ad should be presented or rejected."

The key point I want to bring up is that working in the industry is quite different than doing projects in school. When you do research in school, you just focus on one area, find a solution, publish a paper, and get some numbers. In the industry it is better for you to have broader knowledge of the product, the business, and the engineering. The research and experience you get from university is only a part of it. The other part is how you put everything together and how your work impacts the company's business. The best thing is when you can find something you are really interested in that also matches the company's goals."

          "question": "What drove you to choose a STEM career path in math and computer science (CS), and what motivates you to pursue artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning?",
          "answer": "When I studied math as an undergraduate, my major also dealt with computational mathematics, numerical analysis and computer science. I decided to pursue computer science in graduate school and I got my PhD degree here in the US. At the time I just applied to companies and would join whatever company made me an offer. I got two offers, one on the West Coast and the other on the East Coast. I had already been studying in California for four years, so I decided to join Yahoo in the Bay Area for my first job. \n\n The first job is really important. If you can find the first job offer, that completes the transition from newly graduated to working in the industry. You will learn a lot from it. For my career, I found that I’ve always been working in the area of fraud detection, anti-spam, and integrity. It’s not really related to what I learned or studied during my degree at UC Riverside, but for some reason I just continued working in this area and was still interested in it. For the long term of your career, you want to find something you have a passion for, which may not be related to your master’s or bachelor’s degree’s study."

          "question": "How did you respond when you found out that a lot of what you are doing in your career is different from what you had learned in school?",
          "answer" : "There is always new technology coming out, especially in the software engineering and computer science areas. No matter what you are learning at school, you will have to learn about new things being developed in the industry. For graduate or Master’s students, it's important that you have a major, but the most important thing is that you gain the ability to learn. That learning ability is really important and will help you in the industry. I studied at UCR for four years to get my PhD, and I feel like the process was really helpful. You have to deal with struggle. You have to publish your paper, you have to make sure it is accepted, you have to improve it. At least for computer science, most people’s work in the industry will not exactly match what they did in school. But how you deal with these difficulties in school will really help you in your career."

        {
          "question": "Do you think it’s better for a CS major to go into a PhD program or to get an early entrance into the industry?",
          "answer": "It depends on the individual. If you want to gain deeper knowledge in your field, you can apply to a graduate school and finish a PhD degree. If you only want to work in the industry, then a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in computer science is enough. On the other hand, if you want to join a research department in big companies like Google or Facebook doing cutting-edge research, then you need a PhD from top universities. A PhD degree is not a requirement, but it’s also not a waste of time. You may spend three or four more years doing it, but you're learning in the process and it will help your career in the long term."

          "question": "I think a lot of people are facing this situation where we're looking for our first work experience but then other jobs are asking for prior experience. Is there any advice you can give to overcome that?",
          "answer": "Every summer, there are many companies that have openings for internships. Most people can start to prepare for applying to these internships when they’re in their second, third, or fourth year. If you are doing an internship at Facebook and you’re doing really well, they can decide to hire you directly after the six-month internship. For Google, after an internship, you can do a very quick on-site interview. Because you already have a mentor and a recommendation letter, you will have a higher chance of converting into a full time job. An internship is an opportunity, so just apply to it. On the other hand, I was also rejected by many companies. I got my first job from Yahoo, but I was rejected by many companies too, so it happens to everybody. Just don't give up. Just keep trying and keep improving. Have a positive attitude towards the interview. Don't take the rejection personally. Just try to improve yourself every time, and pick out which part you can improve: communication, coding, preparation, storytelling, etc. Improve yourself from each failure, then as time goes on, you will get the first job. Just stay calm. Don't give up. I know the first job is always hard, but if you just continue to do it and try, you will get it."
        },
        {
          "question": "What did you learn in your first internship that solidified later career paths?",
          "answer": "Actually, I didn't really do an internship in a big company; my internship was from my PhD advisor. He was collaborating with some local company, so I did an internship with them as part of a research project with my professor. In that case I didn't do an interview. My professor just referred me to the company, but I still learned a lot, such as research, MATLAB, coding, and design from that internship."

          "question": "What do you think could be the future trend of AI and how might it develop?",
          "answer": "I'm not an expert on AI, to be honest. Even though I know some machine learning, my daily job is not really involved in that. I'm still doing some risk modeling with AI, but I'm not doing the rewrites or the cutting-edge model training. But I will say, one trend of AI is moving towards more powerful computing. You can see that now with DeepMind, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. High computing power will give you much better results than what we currently have, and will open the door for new opportunities that include cloud computing, like Amazon's cloud computing. Another trend is more on the technical side; there are new models coming out to combine different data sets to train the model. The other trend is related to mobile computing.You know cell phones can do everything, but it still is not enough because of the bandwidth limitation in 4G. Now because of 5G and 6G techniques, your cell phone can be much more powerful which opens up many opportunities for different applications. \n\n I think AI makes people work more efficiently. For example, Amazon uses AI for product distribution. We already leverage robots and machines to perform automatic distribution and do some of this easy work, so humans can just focus on management and monitoring this process. You can see that trade between countries now occurs at high speeds. In the past, Amazon’s impact could only reach a limited group of people over a long time, but now with these scalable AI robot distribution centers, it can operate at much faster speeds and can reach people globally. In the hands of AI, work is more efficient. The other thing is AI is doing cutting-edge research for health. Scientists are trying to leverage AI to do cancer analysis, diabetes checks and for problems in protein folding. For example, Google made a contact lens that can help people with diabetes monitor the glucose levels in your body. Before, you had to use a needle and blood to monitor your glucose levels. \n\n In cancer and disease analysis, many experienced doctors have to go over many X-ray films [or pathology slides] to get enough results to determine if there is cancer. With AI and computer reading technology, this can be done by machines with higher accuracy. This makes the doctors’ work easier because the machine tells them if there is cancer, and the doctors just have to double check instead of checking through thousands of films by themselves. The other side of AI is the challenge that in the future if AI is working in all areas, people have to ask, “How can I improve myself to embrace these changes and to work together with AI techniques to make my work more efficient and essential?”. This is a big topic, including AI ethics, or how we use AI. People are doing unbiased learning to ensure that the AI is unbiased, and there are rules that AI cannot be used by the military."

          "question": "What advice would you give to someone who doesn't really know what their passion is or what they want to pursue?",
          "answer": "Since you're still young, you can try to do whatever you want to do. The goal at the beginning of your career is to get hands-on experience in different areas. It is fine that you don't have the passion at the beginning, but as you're trying different things, you're learning. As time goes on, you'll have figured out what you really want to do. Someone might say, “Hey, I really want to do something related to program management, I want to talk to people'', then one day transfer from being a software engineer to program manager. That is very normal in the industry. I know some people that transitioned from being a doctor to computer science. It's very common to change mid-career. When I was at Google, we had a medical professor from some university in France join our team who just liked coding. Another engineer would come to the office around 3pm, and work until 9pm at night, because she was working as a part-time doctor in a hospital in the morning. There are many careers you can do. But just keep trying, you will find what you want to do. I can only speak for a computer science major. For some other majors, like in medicine, you will always have to go through the process of doing a residency, then many years of practicing to become a doctor. I see computer science as flexible because you can transition to other positions. It might not apply to other areas."

For college students, if you can find a good mentor, which is what CCE is doing, I think that is very good and meaningful. No matter if they’re young professionals, or people already working in the industry for some time, they can give you advice. They can set examples that college students can see and learn from. Also, try to go beyond the university and get some real working experience, in terms of an internship. You can learn a lot even at a part-time position, and that can help you bridge the gap between what you learn from school and the skills you need for a real industry job."

          "question": "Tips for People Interested in Computer Science Career",
          "answer": "If you are already in the computer science major, focus on the study. I know in US universities, the computer science department teaches a lot from theory to real projects. If you finish all the projects and homework with 100% effort, you will learn a lot and you can also learn the really basic skills, including data structures, introduction to algorithm architecture, and other classics in computer science that are really fundamental and that you will want to learn. For other students that are not in the computer science major yet and have additional time, I will say there are two options. One is that there are many online courses like Coursera, Udacity, and other online resources, where you can get the first step into computer science. The other is if you're still in university, you can try to audit or join a class in the computer science department to see whether you like it or not. After one semester you will get more information and more of a feeling about whether you really like this field, because there is a lot of coding and coding theory in the homework. I think you definitely need to expose yourself to the actual classes and do hands-on learning before you can decide whether that's something that you want to go for and to build a good foundation as you prepare for a career in industry."

Fortunately, I happened to attend several talks in my junior year given by world-class scholars and leading industry practitioners, which enlightened me to study the manufacturing system, which was a subfield of Industrial Engineering. That eventually inspired me to pursue my PhD degree in Operations Research, which is one of the core theoretical pillars of Industrial Engineering. My research was about how to make optimal decisions when facing uncertainties, where I got intensive training in statistics, probability, and optimization, which are the fundamentals of today’s AI and data science."

          "answer": "I am currently the director of application engineering at Voltraware Semiconductor Co. We establish design housing that specializes in wireless power-related IC (integrated circuit) design. The application for IC is based on magnetic resonance (MR) technology. This technology is different from the magnetic induction wireless charging that we see in our smartphones and smartwatches. The main difference between these two is that the MR system that we are now developing offers wireless charging that can produce and maintain power delivery to multiple devices with different power requirements. Most importantly, MR systems have a longer charging distance. These features provide a user experience that is closer to the expectations that people have for true wireless charging. Internally, my job involves advising the development of wireless power, protocol planning, specification development, architectural level design, and functional verification and application testing for IC. I also do a lot of external work such as technology and product promotion, research on the needs of potential clients and markets, and networking with our strategic partners. I need to not only understand the technology, but also how this technology is useful for our potential clients. There's a saying that “good technology is only helpful when you really are helping people''.

          "question": "What is the driving force behind your work and what you’re pursuing?",
          "answer": "In my final year of university, I worked on a project to develop a wireless charging race car. This project was really interesting as every student had to contribute to the project to create the best design that would produce a really fast and stable car. I didn't know that power transfer could be done wirelessly because it was something I had never seen before in my life. It got me thinking about wireless charging as the future of conventional power delivery, which could be something worth looking into. When I graduated from university, I found out that our university was really focused on wireless power research and it was one of the few pioneers in the world working in this field. One of the most important things in choosing a post-graduate institution is to find a school that is focused on a certain field that you are really interested in because you can get more resources, mentors, and experience. In addition, if your lab is focused on a specific research area, they can get more laboratory instruments that are definitely helpful for your research. After I found out that I was interested in wireless power research, I began to dig into the field and discovered that there are quite a few things about this area that keep me passionate about this work. I know that this technology brings many conveniences to people's daily life and it's going to change how people behave now, so my work will definitely have some impact on the future. 15 years ago, wireless power technology was not being explored enough. In 2007, the first demonstrations of power transferring systems to transfer power from two meters away didn't get much attention because the demand and practical implications were not really there. But now for almost everything that you see, like cars, motorcycles, and bikes, everyone is talking about wireless charging because they realized how convenient this technology is. I think the reason why I wanted to pursue wireless power technology is because I know that it's going to have a huge impact on our daily life. I also see a lot of potential in this technology in its different applications, for example, as a necessary method for charging medical implants."

          "question": "Can you talk about your educational path and the process you took to get to where you are today?",
          "answer" : "When I was in Taiwan for junior high school, I remember I was really bad at memorizing historical dates, names of historical figures, and geographical locations. At the time, I thought that I wasn’t as smart as the other kids in my class. I later found out that the subjects I was bad at were not difficult, but rather I didn't find them interesting. I didn't bother to remember all the dates and names. After I moved to New Zealand at 13 years old, I discovered that I was really interested in biology, math, and physics and found that I could be really good at them. When you are in school, I think it is beneficial to focus on the things that you are interested in because you are more likely to pay attention and dig deeper into those courses, which can help you in discovering your interests. \n\n After graduating from high school, I got into electrical engineering because that was the only major that I was interested in. Because I only focused on the things I’m good at and interested in, it was easy for me to choose one path and to eliminate all the other options. I focused on wireless power systems because I realized that finding practical applications for wireless power was a critical problem for this technology. If we want to make a cost-effective solution that can be easily adopted by consumers, we have to come up with wireless power applications and ways to implement them. Normally, a solution to an engineering problem depends on how you look at the problem, so there can be several solutions depending on the situation or environment that you are dealing with. You can then choose one of the proposed solutions that is the best fit for that kind of environment. \n\n After I graduated from college, I started to think about how there were not many people who are working with wireless charging, despite it being an interesting and critical field in the market. I decided to move back to Taiwan and started a business with a partner to focus our work solely on the solution for the lack of applications for wireless power. Because I was in charge, I realized that there are not many people who are focused on wireless power technology in Taiwan, which made it very difficult to recruit people with a lot of background knowledge on wireless power. However, difficult problems can be an opportunity to explore different possibilities and ways of doing things. I needed to share my knowledge on wireless power with all my colleagues to bring everyone up to the same level so we could all think about how to work together to solve the problems we faced. You can't be fighting and figuring out a problem by yourself. Working in a team with people who have different specialties allows room to provide different opinions and perspectives on the same problem, which can actually solve the problem in a more comprehensive, faster, and creative way."

        {
          "question": "When you said that there are not many people working on wireless charging, how did you recognize that as an opportunity? How do you deal with the uncertainties and challenges of an underdeveloped field?",
          "answer": "Usually when people are approaching an underdeveloped field, the first thing that comes to mind is the issue of finances. However, I didn't think too much about the financial side of starting a company. I was more focused on technology development. I do believe that there are a lot of risks that we have to take into consideration, especially when there are not many people working in the same field. Sometimes I feel like the whole market looks like a jungle, and I don't know what I will get if I walk into it. To be frank, for the first six to seven years, we barely made a profit from the technology that we developed. We were too focused on technology promotion and trying to come up with a design that fit our imagination of the clients' needs, which is definitely not a realistic approach. If you don't interact with your client enough, get to know the market well, or understand the clients’ demands, the only thing that you're going to develop is a product that only fits your expectations and imaginations, but not your clients’. That was a big failure for us. We had developed something that looked pretty nice, and we thought that was a perfect solution for certain applications. We produced a “perfect” product for our clients, but they didn't give us positive feedback on it. Afterwards, we realized that we needed to rethink and redo the design processes to address their requirements. \n\n One of the risks of working in a field where there are not many people working in the same field is that no one can tell you if you are doing the wrong thing. But on the other hand, if you are doing something that other people are also doing, you are going to look at a market that will be saturated by people in a few years, or even in a few months because they are doing something that already has a demand and is something people already know. If you put your head into something that people don't really know, it's just at that moment in time, they didn't know that they needed it. But if you can see the need for your product, you can see its potential. If you can see what the technology can actually bring to people, you should be confident enough to actually put your hands into that area. When Apple announced its first smartphone, people were confused about what they are going to do with this phone. It didn’t even have buttons, and they had no idea how to use it. When people realized that the smartphone brought the cell phone user experience to the next level, people started to follow in Apple’s steps."

        {
          "question": "What do you think wireless power is moving towards in the future? Is wireless power currently in a primitive stage, just like smartphones were when Apple first introduced them?",
          "answer": "Yes. I believe that the wireless power that we see now in smartphones or smartwatches is not at its final stage. The reason why I say this is because the wireless charging we see now in the smartphone is just a fundamental, cost-effective solution that can bring wireless power into our daily life, but it is not the perfect solution. If you ask anyone who is working on wireless power, you would probably get a very similar answer. The reason why we are adopting wireless power is because we want a fairly good charging distance and good spatial freedom, which is our ultimate expectation for wireless charging. So far, I don’t believe there is anything like this on the market. The solution we see on the market nowadays is just something that companies are trying to get a profit out of, and unfortunately it has become an industry standard. They developed a product and released it even though they knew that the product is not perfect. We should dedicate time to bringing this technology into the best shape it can be. It should have features like further transferring distance, high efficiency, simultaneous one-to-multiple charging, and most importantly, spatial freedom, which means that as long as you put your receiver on the charging pad you should be able to continuously charge without any interference."

          "question": "Tips for College Students",
          "answer": "I remember when I was in university or high school, many courses weren't mandatory. Some friends of mine decided to choose easier courses because they wanted to get good grades on their reports. I also remember that some other friends and I decided to take the courses that we thought were more useful. Those courses may involve many engineering mathematics, or a high workload every week. I think it was worth it because I still use a lot of the engineering mathematics and skills that I had accumulated back then in my work today. I think my advice is don't take the shortcut, or stated in a positive way, use your time wisely on the things that you think are worth investing in. If you know that you're going to an administrative job, of course you need to know how to use Excel, spreadsheets, or something like that. But if you know that you are going to be a power-system engineer, then you need to be familiar with simulation tools. If you are going to be an electronic design engineer, you need to know how the operational amplifier works. If you know that you are going in a certain direction, then you have to reflect on the skill sets that you need to have to make your life easier in the future. I remember that when I knew that I was going to focus on electronics design, I took several courses that were directly related to that, and I still use a lot of skills and the knowledge I learned from that time period. \n\n I think interacting more with people is another important thing. Most of my peers back in the day were just trying to pass their courses, so they spent a lot of time purely on studying. However, I’ve realized that once you start working, you come to know that you can only achieve so much by yourself, and those achievements cannot be greater than a group of people who share the same vision. If you can cultivate really good relationship and communication skills, a lot of problems can be communicated to and easily solved by a group of people, not just by yourself. I think interactions with people are another important aspect that we need to cultivate when we are still in school. \n\n Another important piece of advice is to focus on the things that you are going to do. Focus on the courses that you believe are going to help you in the future. We need to have a core belief, a passion, or a certain path that we want to take. After we have decided this path, then we have to take a step back and think about what would allow us to achieve or go to that path. We need to set up goals for ourselves, and then we need to set a direction. For example, once you realize you want to be an electrical engineer, you need to know what you need to do to get yourself prepared to go onto that path. If you know that you need to get into the electrical engineering major, you need to figure out what you need to do in high school or college to prepare for that major. I think that is a logical way of pursuing things."

          "answer": "I believe some people already have a vision, so they know how to pursue something that they want. For the group of people who are still unsure about what they're going to do, I think the best way is to listen to other people, and ask yourself questions. A good starting point is to explore as many things as possible. For example, math, physics, chemistry, or anything. Nowadays you can get a lot of information from the internet. You can also talk to your friends in school or actually go to a few classes on different topics to see how you like them, so you will have more of an idea of what's your interests and passions. Talk to people. Talk to your friends, seniors, or even people who are already working. How did they figure out what they wanted? All those interactions can give you a lot of ideas about how you can choose your path, how you can choose your major, or choose the things that you want to do. I understand that a lot of people have trouble knowing what they want to do, but after you talk to a lot of people, you will start to realize that it is not difficult to choose. The reason why people are having trouble choosing is because they don’t have enough information. Once you have enough information, you will know what you are good at and what you are passionate about."

          "question": "Tips for People Interested in STEM Career Path",
          "answer": "I think my advice is more of a general one. For people who are pursuing a STEM career path, we need to realize that we need to have a fundamental understanding of various concepts, rather than just memorizing them. You need to know that, when I use this equation, when I talk about this concept, when I am trying to develop this product, I know exactly what I am doing. You cannot just follow people’s footsteps, or try to mimic something that you don't really know that well. I say this because when I came back to Taiwan, I realized that a lot of research and development work is done by copying reference designs that are provided by other companies, so engineers tend to use other people’s design, and maybe modify them into a product. That is not research and development, but rather production engineering. I think something that we need to think about is that we chose this career path because we like to understand the fundamental concepts of each idea, even if it is just an equation or a formula. When we are taking a test, we should quote an equation because we understand it, not just because we memorized it. If you can really do that, you can have that equation to go with you for the entire life, rather than continuously memorizing and forgetting it. It will really help if we really understand these concepts instead of memorizing them.\n\n I remember once I was talking to a client who gave me some negative feedback. While the colleague who went with me did not ask too many questions about what was wrong with the product, I felt the urge to understand why he was unsatisfied with our product. I asked a lot of questions like, “why do you have this kind of feeling? Why does this not meet your demand? What's the main reason you can't sell this to your customers? What do you think about the application value of this product to other products? What do you think is a reasonable price for this product?”. The questions we ask determine what kind of person we are. If you are not a person who wants to know the details you will only ask superficial questions, but if you want to get to the bottom of everything that you have your hands on, you will ask critical questions to get the information that you want. I believe that also echoes what I said before, that we need to get to the fundamental stuff, because everything we do shows what kind of person we are. Especially for someone who is pursuing a STEM career path, that is a quality that we need to succeed."

          "answer": "Hi! I am Ray Chang and I am a second-year bioengineering PhD student at Stanford. I am in Professor Manu Prakash’s lab, and I am working on the fluid mechanics problem of an interesting freshwater ciliate calledSpirostomum ambiguum using both theoretical and experimental approaches. To be more specific, Spirostomum is a giant single cell organism (it can grow up to 4 mm in length!) with an exceptional ability to perform ultrafast contractions; the maximum acceleration in the contraction process can be up to 15G! A normal human cannot tolerate such high acceleration, but this organism uses the hydrodynamic pulse wave generated by the contraction as a communication tool and must be able to perform such a task repetitively without damaging itself. I am looking at the intracellular organization of this organism to see how the internal structure helps dissipate the energy generated in this process. \n\n Aside from this project, I also play an assistant role in other frugal science projects related to the medical field in our lab because of my background in medicine. For example, our lab is working on converting a commercially-available snorkel mask into personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers, or into an interface for noninvasive ventilation. I have worked on designing PPE donning, doffing and disinfection protocol, and some physiological testing. This dual role is very common in our lab: most of us work as the primary lead of our own project but also have a supportive role for other members’ projects. \n\n <iframe title=\"spirosto\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/aPy_8x182UA\" width=\"660\" height=\"320\" allowFullScreen></iframe> \n\n In the long run, I am interested in pursuing an academic career, with a potential focus on cellular biophysics. There are many interesting problems in the unseen microscopic world. For example, how does a single cell sustain its needs when it grows to a large size? How does the cell transmit signals across the cell without an action potential? Is it a common strategy for cells to modify its internal structure for energy dissipation purposes? These are all fundamental questions which require careful experimental design from a strong theoretical point of view, which is why I find them so fascinating! \n\n <iframe title=\"ambiguum\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/--9LSS4dvmA\" width=\"660\" height=\"320\" allowFullScreen ></iframe>"

          "question": "Why do you do what you do now?",
          "answer": "This is an interesting question. I think the most important reason why I am a researcher is because it is fun. It is fun to ask these seemingly random questions which actually carry serious fundamental meanings. It is fun to see what life (other than model organisms) looks like and how they evolve really fascinating strategies to tackle the problems unique to their scale. If you want to learn more about how fun such a world could be, I encourage you to explore a therapeutic YouTube channel called “Journey to the Microcosmos”. While I wanted to study biophysics in graduate school, I couldn’t apply for a PhD in a biophysics program because of funding issues surrounding my foreigner status. Instead, I was able to apply for a bioengineering program because it provides a more quantitative point of view compared to other branches in bioscience. However, I think bioengineering is a good fit for me as its fundamental research matches my interests while its application matches my abilities. \n\n One reason why I am currently aiming for an academic career is because I enjoy teaching. I hope that a more quantitative mindset can someday become the second “central dogma” in biology: living organisms have to obey the laws of physics, and these laws set a predictable constraint on what they can do and how they can perform a specific task. In my 4th year of medical school I started a blog called “Three Minute Biophysics” to educate myself and others about both classic and modern research in biophysics. I like to share with other people joyful and insightful moments when physics and biology marry together, and I think those tiny moments are what motivate me to explore all the unanswered questions we have about biology. \n\n The other reason why I am considering an academic job is because I appreciate the freedom of academia. I want to work on something that I genuinely find interesting, even if its application may not be evident at first glance. I believe that only through studying these peculiar microorganisms can we truly understand the limits of life and what a living creature is capable of. Staying in academia after graduation will allow me to continue studying unique microorganisms that are seemingly unimportant but could provide novel solutions to the problems we have today."

          "question": "How did you end up doing what you do now?",
          "answer": "I entered medical school after high school because I was not sure about what I wanted to do. Even though I had been thinking about doing research back then, I didn’t feel passionate enough about pure biology research to major in biology. I was also interested in physics but was not very confident in my abilities to major in physics. During my freshman year, I got really interested in psychology. I spent all my free time voraciously reading all kinds of psychology books and I thought I would one day become a psychiatrist. \n\n However, in my sophomore year, I felt that I had learned enough psychology to interpret and handle my own personality and interpersonal relationship problems, and psychology became less interesting to me. I decided to take a psychology and a physics elective at the same time to see which one I enjoyed more. The physics class I took was “Introduction to Biophysics” taught by Dr. Po-Ling Kuo, and it completely changed my life. I was so inspired by how physics can be used to predict a diverse range of biological problems, and I really enjoyed the textbook, “Physical Biology of the Cell” written by Rob Phillips. After chatting with Dr. Kuo during an office hour about my interests in pursuing biophysics, he invited me to join his lab and I worked with him part time for 4 years. \n\n After joining Dr. Kuo’s lab, I prepared myself for a career in biophysics. I knew that my physics and math abilities were not going to be as good as a physics major student, so I devoted all my free time to self-studying physics and math. I was very lucky to have a friend who was also interested in physics and would study with me, and I miss the times when he would message me with a question and ask me to solve it. As medical school classes were quite heavy, I had to stay in the library for the entire day and even on weekends. Even though that may sound miserable, I appreciated that time when I could enjoy the pure joy of knowledge. \n\n 7 years of medical school was still a long journey and I had questioned my decisions from time to time. Over the 7 years, I thought about becoming a psychiatrist, nephrologist, pathologist, cardiologist and neurologist at different stages of my training while still doubting my abilities to study physics. However, I am glad that constant exposure to the inspiration of research helped me overcome my doubt and pointed me in the direction I should go. When I would write a new post for my blog introducing others’ great work, I wished that I could become part of that community. I wished I could try to explore my own limits, and to one day introduce my own work on my blog! With that in mind, I decided to apply for graduate school during my final (internship) year in medical school. \n\n In my intern year, I had more responsibilities taking care of patients and needed to regularly stay on duty, which gave me a chance to imagine what my life would be like if I decided to stay in hospital work. I felt the need to constantly engage in difficult conversations around patient status and the uncertainty around staying on duty was draining to me. Even though I performed very well during my internship and received positive feedback from my senior colleagues, I felt that I was giving the patients suboptimal care because I was not the best possible “me”. In addition, I realized that the emotional burden of working at a hospital prevented me from maintaining my biophysics studying hobby, which forced me to make a decision between the two. Luckily, I got into Stanford with God’s help and my past investment in applying for graduate school, and I really appreciate the chance."

          "question": "Tips for College Students",
          "answer" : "As a college student, the advice I would give is to explore your interests and start preparing yourself early. I would not have been admitted to graduate school if I only started preparing for it in my 5th or 6th year of medical school. Having a clear direction is more important than blindly wasting your efforts. Spend your time exploring your passions when the cost of failure is still low, really dive into the one that you love, and plan early for your long-term goals. I hope everyone can eventually work on something they are passionate about! \n\n Another thing that I found very helpful is to embrace a growth mindset. Intelligence can be built and we should believe in our abilities to learn. There is a stereotype that students in biology or medicine are bad at math and physics, and I think that is very toxic and detrimental. I would not have the courage to apply to graduate school and to work on my current project if I didn’t believe in my ability to learn, and trust in yourself takes time and effort to nurture."

          "question": "Tips for High School Students",
          "answer": "I was very lucky to have graduated from Taipei Municipal Jianguo (former name Chien-Kuo) Senior High School, a high school that gives its students more freedom than any other high school. Every student is encouraged to do whatever they want, and there is a strong atmosphere in the school that if you want to do something, you should aim for the best. Therefore, our high school is famous in almost every aspect: from international science Olympiad, science fair, pop dance club, rugby team, to color guard team, because everyone is aiming for the best. I also remember when I had naturalist hobbies such as plant identification, and I bought many plant atlases just to study how to differentiate them. I encourage everyone to be serious about the things you like, and really invest time to do research on it and to practice [what you learned]."

          "question": "Tips for People Interested in Medical School",
          "answer": "I also have advice for people who are interested in medical school. There are many aspects of medicine that are very different from what ordinary people imagine a medical career to be. Uncovering the mysteries of the human brain or finding cures for cancer are not going to be a major part of your training, and your hospital volunteering experiences will be very different from a usual day as a healthcare worker. A huge aspect of medicine is having to communicate terrible news to an already shattered family. As you get more and more accustomed to the practical know-how of taking care of a patient, it is possible to become emotionally worn out by seemingly trivial details that actually become huge roadblocks to treatment flow, such as health insurance status, bed availability of post-acute care facilities, or missing family members who hold the power to make decisions for a patient. Think carefully before you apply to medical school, and remember to take care of yourself if you are admitted."

          "answer": "Hi, I am David Pan, a professor and holder of the Silicon Labs Endowed Chair at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin. I got my PhD in Computer Science from UCLA in 2000 (wow, 20 years ago!). Before joining UT Austin, I worked at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center for three years, from 2000 to 2003. My research is quite interdisciplinary, from algorithms and software to chip design/manufacturing and emerging technologies. At UT Austin, I teach digital logic design, as well as VLSI (very-large-scale integration) and CAD (computer aided design) courses. I also direct the UT Design Automation (UTDA) Lab. You may wonder what design automation is about. When you design modern integrated circuits (or chips) and systems, which nowadays can have billions of transistors with feature size in the nanometer (10-9 meter) scale, you have to rely on all kinds of sophisticated design automation or CAD tools and software. My research’s main focus is to develop cutting edge algorithms and software that enable these complex design and optimization processes."

        {
          "question": "What is the driving force behind your work and what you pursue?",
          "answer": "The “why” behind my work is very simple: to design better chips faster with higher performance, lower power, lower cost, etc. You might have heard about Moore’s Law, the amazing law that has been driving the semiconductor and information technology industries for more than 50 years. My research is related to  how to extend and expand Moore’s Law through intelligent design and technology co-optimizations. I have collaborated with many industry partners, including IBM, Intel, Nvidia, Xilinx, Cadence, Synopsys, Google, etc., and many of our research results have been widely used in industry to develop cutting-edge chips. To see your work having real impact is very satisfying. \n\n I have worked in both academia and industry. Both have pros and cons, and you just have to ask yourself where you feel most “empowered”. Academia typically looks at longer-term and more fundamental research problems, with no immediate product pressure. On the other hand, since we are in electrical and computer engineering which tie very closely with various industries, we do need to talk frequently to those industry colleagues to understand their needs so that we can identify the most important problems to work on. In academia, I generally have freedom to pursue the topics that I’m interested in (well, if I manage to get funding and students to work on them ☺). On the other hand, big companies like IBM, Intel, Google have much more resources, such as the most advanced technology nodes and data centers. That’s why some professors move to industry. It’s really a personal choice. But we can also send students to perform collaborative research. For me, the biggest accomplishment as a professor is the students. Seeing them grow and be successful makes me happy and keeps me going!"

          "question": "How did you end up doing what you do now?",
          "answer": "I took an unconventional path to become an electrical and computer engineering professor. My undergraduate major at Peking University was physics, or specifically geophysics. I came to UCLA to pursue my graduate study in Atmospheric Sciences in 1993, and my first research at UCLA was on some millennium-scale climate change problem. After two years of study and research, I developed some theoretical and numerical models, but then the problem arrived: how can I verify the correctness of my model in my lifetime? Incidentally I took some Computer Science classes at that time, and found my new passion in VLSI and CAD. I like solving hard problems, and VLSI CAD seems to have lots of very intriguing and “mission impossible” problems. And more importantly, you will know how good your solutions are very quickly, within hours or days! Of course, I had to make up a lot of knowledge and courses in EE [Electrical Engineering] and CS. On the other hand, my physics training gave me good intuition in formulating and solving those problems. My UCLA PhD ended nicely with an Outstanding PhD Award, and I then joined IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, which at that time was the top industry research lab in VLSI and CAD. I learned a lot at IBM and contributed to their key EDA tool called placement driven synthesis (PDS) which is still widely used in IBM. After three years with IBM, UT Austin happened to have a faculty opening in my research area. So here I am. \n\n As I look back, life is VERY hard to predict. You just have to follow your passion, become your best self, and when opportunities knock, be ready."

I think you should explore your interests, and try to find something that you feel really passionate about (and hopefully you are also talented and good at). Of course, our interests could change later in life. But college is a great place to learn new things and perform “trial and error”. Be open-minded, listen to great speakers from not only your immediate major areas but other areas too while your schedule allows. Make some really good friends!"

          "question": "Tips for People Interested in STEM",
          "answer": "For those students who are interested in a STEM career path, it’s certainly important to build solid STEM foundations and problem-solving skills. But it is equally important to hone your communication skills including writing, presentation, leadership and teamwork. Either you know how to do it, or you know how to find people who know how to do it. Don’t be a loner. For example in CS, there are so many open-source codes you can build upon. Do not reinvent the wheel. Do not be afraid to ask for help or mentoring from senior people. They are often not as intimidating as you might think. STEM students should not be just “nerds”. They are problem solvers and future change makers. To achieve that goal, you need to work with others."
